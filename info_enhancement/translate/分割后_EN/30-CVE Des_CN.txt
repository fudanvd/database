CVE-2016-4288||A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in BlueStacks App Player. The BlueStacks App Player installer creates a registry key with weak permissions that allows users to execute arbitrary programs with SYSTEM privileges.
CVE-2016-4289||A stack based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the method receiving data from SysTreeView32 control of the GMER 2.1.19357 application. A specially created long path can lead to a buffer overflow on the stack resulting in code execution. An attacker needs to create path longer than 99 characters to trigger this vulnerability.
CVE-2016-4290||When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space for a block of data within the file. When calculating this length, the application will use a value from the file and add a constant to it without checking whether the addition of the constant will cause the integer to overflow which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data into it. This allows one to overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.
CVE-2016-4291||When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will use a field from the structure in an operation that can cause the integer to overflow. This result is then used to allocate memory to copy file data in. Due to the lack of bounds checking on the integer, the allocated memory buffer can be made to be undersized at which point the reading of file data will write outside the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
CVE-2016-4292||When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will use a static size to allocate a heap buffer yet explicitly trust a size from the file when modifying data inside of it. Due to this, an aggressor can corrupt memory outside the bounds of this buffer which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
CVE-2016-4293||Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the (1) CBookBase::SetDefTableStyle and (2) CBookBase::SetDefPivotStyle functions in Hancom Office 2014 VP allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) file.
CVE-2016-4294||When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a property record within the Workbook stream, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space for an element using a length from the file. When copying user-supplied data to this buffer, however, the application will use a different size which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. This vulnerability can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.
CVE-2016-4295||When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a particular record within the Workbook stream, an index miscalculation leading to a heap overlow can be made to occur in Hancom Office 2014. The vulnerability occurs when processing data for a formula used to render a chart via the HncChartPlugin.hplg library. Due to a lack of bounds-checking when incrementing an index that is used for writing into a buffer for formulae, the application can be made to write pointer data outside its bounds which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
CVE-2016-4296||When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a record that uses the CSSValFormat object, Hancom Office 2014 will search for an underscore ("_") character at the end of the string and write a null terminator after it. If the character is at the very end of the string, the application will mistakenly write the null-byte outside the bounds of its destination. This can result in heap corruption that can lead code execution under the context of the application
CVE-2016-4298||When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space for a list of elements using a length from the file. When calculating this length, an integer overflow can be made to occur which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data into the object containing this structure. This allows one to overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.
CVE-2016-4300||Integer overflow in the read_SubStreamsInfo function in archive_read_support_format_7zip.c in libarchive before 3.2.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a 7zip file with a large number of substreams, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2016-5124||An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev14. Adding images from external sources to HTML editors by drag&drop can potentially lead to script code execution in the context of the active user. To exploit this, a user needs to be tricked to use an image from a specially crafted website and add it to HTML editor areas of OX App Suite, for example E-Mail Compose or OX Text. This specific attack circumvents typical XSS filters and detection mechanisms since the code is not loaded from an external service but injected locally. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). To exploit this vulnerability, a attacker needs to convince a user to follow specific steps (social-engineering).

CVE-2016-6595||** DISPUTED ** The SwarmKit toolkit 1.12.0 for Docker allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (prevention of cluster joins) via a long sequence of join and quit actions.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that this sequence is not "removing the state that is left by old nodes. At some point the manager obviously stops being able to accept new nodes, since it runs out of memory. Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a secret token (it's actually the only mode of operation), this means that no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources. We can't do anything about a manager running out of memory and not being able to add new legitimate nodes to the system. This is merely a resource provisioning issue, and definitely not a CVE worthy vulnerability."

CVE-2016-6908||Characters from languages are such as Arabic, Hebrew are displayed from RTL (Right To Left) order in Opera 37.0.2192.105088 for Android, due to mishandling of several unicode characters such as U+FE70, U+0622, U+0623 etc and how they are rendered combined with (first strong character) such as an IP address or alphabet could lead to a spoofed URL. It was noticed that by placing neutral characters such as "/", "?" in filepath causes the URL to be flipped and displayed from Right To Left. However, in order for the URL to be spoofed the URL must begin with an IP address followed by neutral characters as omnibox considers IP address to be combination of punctuation and numbers and since LTR (Left To Right) direction is not properly enforced, this causes the entire URL to be treated and rendered from RTL (Right To Left). However, it doesn't have be an IP address, what matters is that first strong character (generally, alphabetic character) in the URL must be an RTL character.

CVE-2016-7039||The IP stack in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering use of the GRO path for large crafted packets, as demonstrated by packets that contain only VLAN headers, a related issue to CVE-2016-8666.
CVE-2016-7040||Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 4.1 does not properly handle regular expressions passed to the expression engine via the JSON API and the web-based UI, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary shell commands by leveraging the ability to view and filter collections.
CVE-2016-7041||Drools Workbench contains a path traversal vulnerability. The vulnerability allows a remote, authenticated attacker to bypass the directory restrictions and retrieve arbitrary files from the affected host.
CVE-2016-7042||The proc_keys_show function in security/keys/proc.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2, when the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector is enabled, uses an incorrect buffer size for certain timeout data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) by reading the /proc/keys file.
CVE-2016-7043||It has been reported that KIE server and Busitess Central before version 7.21.0.Final contain username and password as plaintext Java properties. Any app deployed on the same server would have access to these properties, thus granting access to ther services.
CVE-2016-7044||The unformat_24bit_color function in the format parsing code in Irssi before 0.8.20, when compiled with true-color enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap corruption and crash) via an incomplete 24bit color code.
CVE-2016-7045||The format_send_to_gui function in the format parsing code in Irssi before 0.8.20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap corruption and crash) via vectors involving the length of a string.

CVE-2016-7051||XmlMapper in the Jackson XML dataformat component (aka jackson-dataformat-xml) before 2.7.8 and 2.8.x before 2.8.4 allows remote attackers to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks via vectors related to a DTD.
CVE-2016-7052||crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2i allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) by triggering a CRL operation.
CVE-2016-7053||In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, applications parsing invalid CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected.
CVE-2016-7054||In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, TLS connections using *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS.
CVE-2016-7055||There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.
CVE-2016-7056||A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL 1.0.1u and before that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.
