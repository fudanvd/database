CVE-2017-17023||The Sophos UTM VPN endpoint interacts with client software provided by NPC Engineering (www.ncp-e.com). The affected client software, "Sophos IPSec Client" 11.04 is a rebranded version of NCP "Secure Entry Client" 10.11 r32792. A vulnerability in the software update feature of the VPN client allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) or man-on-the-side (MOTS) attacker to execute arbitrary, malicious software on a target user's computer. This is related to SIC_V11.04-64.exe (Sophos), NCP_EntryCl_Windows_x86_1004_31799.exe (NCP), and ncpmon.exe (both Sophos and NCP). The vulnerability exists because: (1) the VPN client requests update metadata over an insecure HTTP connection; and (2) the client software does not check if the software update is signed before running it.

CVE-2017-17433||The recv_files function in receiver.c in the daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, proceeds with certain file metadata updates before checking for a filename in the daemon_filter_list data structure, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
CVE-2017-17434||The daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, does not check for fnamecmp filenames in the daemon_filter_list data structure (in the recv_files function in receiver.c) and also does not apply the sanitize_paths protection mechanism to pathnames found in "xname follows" strings (in the read_ndx_and_attrs function in rsync.c), which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
CVE-2017-17435||An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i products, aka BlueSteal. An attacker can remotely unlock any safe in this product line without a valid PIN code. Even though the phone application requires it and there is a field to supply the PIN code in an authorization request, the safe does not check the PIN code, so an attacker can obtain authorization using any value. Once an attacker sees the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement for the safe, they need only to write a BLE characteristic to enable notifications, and send a crafted getAuthor packet that returns a temporary key, and an unlock packet including that temporary key. The safe then opens after the unlock packet is processed, with no verification of PIN or other credentials.
CVE-2017-17436||An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i products. There is no encryption of the session between the Android application and the safe. The website and marketing materials advertise that this communication channel is encrypted with "Highest Level Bluetooth Encryption" and "Data transmissions are secure via AES256 bit encryption." These claims, however, are not true. Moreover, AES256 bit encryption is not supported in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard, so it would have to be at the application level. This lack of encryption allows an individual to learn the passcode by eavesdropping on the communications between the application and the safe.
CVE-2017-17439||In Heimdal through 7.4, remote unauthenticated attackers are able to crash the KDC by sending a crafted UDP packet containing empty data fields for client name or realm.

This is related to the _kdc_as_rep function in kdc/kerberos5.c and the der_length_visible_string function in lib/asn1/der_length.c.
CVE-2017-17440||GNU Libextractor 1.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted GIF, IT (Impulse Tracker), NSFE, S3M (Scream Tracker 3), SID, or XM (eXtended Module) file, as demonstrated by the EXTRACTOR_xm_extract_method function in plugins/xm_extractor.c.
CVE-2017-17442||In BlackBerry UEM Management Console version 12.7.1 and earlier, a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute script commands in the context of the affected UEM Management Console account by crafting a malicious link and then persuading a user with legitimate access to the Management Console to click on the malicious link.
CVE-2017-17443||OPC Foundation Local Discovery Server (LDS) 1.03.370 required a security update to resolve multiple vulnerabilities that allow attackers to trigger a crash by placing invalid data into the configuration file. This vulnerability requires an attacker with access to the file system where the configuration file is stored; however, if the configuration file is altered the LDS will be unavailable until it is repaired.
CVE-2017-17446||The Mem_File_Reader::read_avail function in Data_Reader.cpp in the Game_Music_Emu library (aka game-music-emu) 0.6.1 does not ensure a non-negative size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted file.
CVE-2017-17448||net/netfilter/nfnetlink_cthelper.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.4 does not require the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for new, get, and del operations, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions because the nfnl_cthelper_list data structure is shared across all net namespaces.
CVE-2017-17449||The __netlink_deliver_tap_skb function in net/netlink/af_netlink.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.4, when CONFIG_NLMON is enabled, does not restrict observations of Netlink messages to a single net namespace, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to sniff an nlmon interface for all Netlink activity on the system.
CVE-2017-17450||net/netfilter/xt_osf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.4 does not require the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for add_callback and remove_callback operations, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions because the xt_osf_fingers data structure is shared across all net namespaces.

There is no authentication of messages beyond the use of the fixed AES key, so message forgery is also possible.
CVE-2017-17707||Due to missing authorization checks, any authenticated user is able to list, upload, or delete attachments to password safe entries in Pleasant Password Server before 7.8.3. To perform those actions on an entry, the user needs to know the corresponding "CredentialId" value, which uniquely identifies a password safe entry. Since "CredentialId" values are implemented as GUIDs, they are hard to guess. However, if for example an entry's owner grants read-only access to a malicious user, the value gets exposed to the malicious user. The same holds true for temporary grants.
CVE-2017-17708||Because of insufficient authorization checks it is possible for any authenticated user to change profile data of other users in Pleasant Password Server before 7.8.3.

IBM X-Force ID: 137036.
CVE-2017-17910||On Hoermann BiSecur devices before 2018, a vulnerability can be exploited by recording a single radio transmission. An attacker can intercept an arbitrary radio frame exchanged between a BiSecur transmitter and a receiver to obtain the encrypted packet and the 32-bit serial number. The interception of the one-time pairing process is specifically not required. Due to use of AES-128 with an initial static random value and static data vector (all of this static information is the same across different customers' installations), the attacker can easily derive the utilized encryption key and decrypt the intercepted packet. The key can be verified by decrypting the intercepted packet and checking for known plaintext. Subsequently, an attacker can create arbitrary radio frames with the correct encryption key to control BiSecur garage and entrance gate operators and possibly other BiSecur systems as well ("wireless cloning"). To conduct the attack, a low cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) is sufficient. This affects Hoermann Hand Transmitter HS5-868-BS, HSE1-868-BS, and HSE2-868-BS devices.
