CVE-2019-0187||Unauthenticated RCE is possible when JMeter is used in distributed mode (-r or -R command line options). Attacker can establish a RMI connection to a jmeter-server using RemoteJMeterEngine and proceed with an attack using untrusted data deserialization. This only affect tests running in Distributed mode. Note that versions before 4.0 are not able to encrypt traffic between the nodes, nor authenticate the participating nodes so upgrade to JMeter 5.1 is also advised.
CVE-2019-0188||Apache Camel prior to 2.24.0 contains an XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability (CWE-611) due to using an outdated vulnerable JSON-lib library. This affects only the camel-xmljson component, which was removed.
CVE-2019-0189||The java.io.ObjectInputStream is known to cause Java serialisation issues. This issue here is exposed by the "webtools/control/httpService" URL, and uses Java deserialization to perform code execution. In the HttpEngine, the value of the request parameter "serviceContext" is passed to the "deserialize" method of "XmlSerializer". Apache Ofbiz is affected via two different dependencies: "commons-beanutils" and an out-dated version of "commons-fileupload" Mitigation: Upgrade to 16.11.06 or manually apply the commits from OFBIZ-10770 and OFBIZ-10837 on branch 16
CVE-2019-0190||A bug exists in the way mod_ssl handled client renegotiations. A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause mod_ssl to enter a loop leading to a denial of service. This bug can be only triggered with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction in changes to handling of renegotiation attempts.
CVE-2019-0191||Apache Karaf kar deployer reads .kar archives and extracts the paths from the "repository/" and "resources/" entries in the zip file. It then writes out the content of these paths to the Karaf repo and resources directories. However, it doesn't do any validation on the paths in the zip file. This means that a malicious user could craft a .kar file with ".." directory names and break out of the directories to write arbitrary content to the filesystem. This is the "Zip-slip" vulnerability - https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability. This vulnerability is low if the Karaf process user has limited permission on the filesystem. Any Apache Karaf releases prior 4.2.3 is impacted.
CVE-2019-0192||In Apache Solr versions 5.0.0 to 5.5.5 and 6.0.0 to 6.6.5, the Config API allows to configure the JMX server via an HTTP POST request. By pointing it to a malicious RMI server, an attacker could take advantage of Solr's unsafe deserialization to trigger remote code execution on the Solr side.
CVE-2019-0193||In Apache Solr, the DataImportHandler, an optional but popular module to pull in data from databases and other sources, has a feature in which the whole DIH configuration can come from a request's "dataConfig" parameter. The debug mode of the DIH admin screen uses this to allow convenient debugging / development of a DIH config. Since a DIH config can contain scripts, this parameter is a security risk. Starting with version 8.2.0 of Solr, use of this parameter requires setting the Java System property "enable.dih.dataConfigParam" to true.
CVE-2019-0194||Apache Camel's File is vulnerable to directory traversal. Camel 2.21.0 to 2.21.3, 2.22.0 to 2.22.2, 2.23.0 and the unsupported Camel 2.x (2.19 and earlier) versions may be also affected.
CVE-2019-0195||Manipulating classpath asset file URLs, an attacker could guess the path to a known file in the classpath and have it downloaded. If the attacker found the file with the value of the tapestry.hmac-passphrase configuration symbol, most probably the webapp's AppModule class, the value of this symbol could be used to craft a Java deserialization attack, thus running malicious injected Java code. The vector would be the t:formdata parameter from the Form component.
CVE-2019-0196||A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.38. Using fuzzed network input, the http/2 request handling could be made to access freed memory in string comparison when determining the method of a request and thus process the request incorrectly.
CVE-2019-0197||A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 to 2.4.38. When HTTP/2 was enabled for a http: host or H2Upgrade was enabled for h2 on a https: host, an Upgrade request from http/1.1 to http/2 that was not the first request on a connection could lead to a misconfiguration and crash. Server that never enabled the h2 protocol or that only enabled it for https: and did not set "H2Upgrade on" are unaffected by this issue.
CVE-2019-0198||** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: The CNA or individual who requested this candidate did not associate it with any vulnerability during 2019. Notes: none.
CVE-2019-0199||The HTTP/2 implementation in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.14 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.37 accepted streams with excessive numbers of SETTINGS frames and also permitted clients to keep streams open without reading/writing request/response data. By keeping streams open for requests that utilised the Servlet API's blocking I/O, clients were able to cause server-side threads to block eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS.
CVE-2019-0200||A Denial of Service vulnerability was found in Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.0.0-7.0.6 (inclusive) and 7.1.0 which allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash the broker instance by sending specially crafted commands using AMQP protocol versions below 1.0 (AMQP 0-8, 0-9, 0-91 and 0-10). Users of Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.0.0-7.0.6 (inclusive) and 7.1.0 utilizing AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9, 0-91, 0-10 must upgrade to Qpid Broker-J versions 7.0.7 or 7.1.1 or later.
CVE-2019-0201||An issue is present in Apache ZooKeeper 1.0.0 to 3.4.13 and 3.5.0-alpha to 3.5.4-beta. ZooKeeper’s getACL() command doesn’t check any permission when retrieves the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information contained in the ACL Id field as plaintext string. DigestAuthenticationProvider overloads the Id field with the hash value that is used for user authentication. As a consequence, if Digest Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by getACL() request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.
CVE-2019-0202||The Apache Storm Logviewer daemon exposes HTTP-accessible endpoints to read/search log files on hosts running Storm. In Apache Storm versions 0.9.1-incubating to 1.2.2, it is possible to read files off the host's file system that were not intended to be accessible via these endpoints.
CVE-2019-0203||In Apache Subversion versions up to and including 1.9.10, 1.10.4, 1.12.0, Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when a client sends certain sequences of protocol commands. This can lead to disruption for users of the server.
CVE-2019-0204||A specifically crafted Docker image running under the root user can overwrite the init helper binary of the container runtime and/or the command executor in Apache Mesos versions pre-1.4.x, 1.4.0 to 1.4.2, 1.5.0 to 1.5.2, 1.6.0 to 1.6.1, and 1.7.0 to 1.7.1. A malicious actor can therefore gain root-level code execution on the host.
CVE-2019-0205||In Apache Thrift all versions up to and including 0.12.0, a server or client may run into an endless loop when feed with specific input data. Because the issue had already been partially fixed in version 0.11.0, depending on the installed version it affects only certain language bindings.

CVE-2019-0210||In Apache Thrift 0.9.3 to 0.12.0, a server implemented in Go using TJSONProtocol or TSimpleJSONProtocol may panic when feed with invalid input data.
CVE-2019-0211||In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.
CVE-2019-0212||In all previously released Apache HBase 2.x versions (2.0.0-2.0.4, 2.1.0-2.1.3), authorization was incorrectly applied to users of the HBase REST server. Requests sent to the HBase REST server were executed with the permissions of the REST server itself, not with the permissions of the end-user. This issue is only relevant when HBase is configured with Kerberos authentication, HBase authorization is enabled, and the REST server is configured with SPNEGO authentication. This issue does not extend beyond the HBase REST server.
CVE-2019-0213||In Apache Archiva before 2.2.4, it may be possible to store malicious XSS code into central configuration entries, i.e. the logo URL. The vulnerability is considered as minor risk, as only users with admin role can change the configuration, or the communication between the browser and the Archiva server must be compromised.
CVE-2019-0214||In Apache Archiva 2.0.0 - 2.2.3, it is possible to write files to the archiva server at arbitrary locations by using the artifact upload mechanism. Existing files can be overwritten, if the archiva run user has appropriate permission on the filesystem for the target file.
CVE-2019-0215||In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.37 and 2.4.38, a bug in mod_ssl when using per-location client certificate verification with TLSv1.3 allowed a client to bypass configured access control restrictions.
CVE-2019-0216||A malicious admin user could edit the state of objects in the Airflow metadata database to execute arbitrary javascript on certain page views.
CVE-2019-0217||In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.38 and prior, a race condition in mod_auth_digest when running in a threaded server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate using another username, bypassing configured access control restrictions.
CVE-2019-0218||A vulnerability was discovered wherein a specially crafted URL could enable reflected XSS via JavaScript in the pony mail interface.
CVE-2019-0219||A website running in the InAppBrowser webview on Android could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the main application's webview using a specially crafted gap-iab: URI.
CVE-2019-0220||A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.38. When the path component of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'), directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers processing will implicitly collapse them.
CVE-2019-0221||The SSI printenv command in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.39 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.93 echoes user provided data without escaping and is, therefore, vulnerable to XSS. SSI is disabled by default. The printenv command is intended for debugging and is unlikely to be present in a production website.
CVE-2019-0222||In Apache ActiveMQ 5.0.0 - 5.15.8, unmarshalling corrupt MQTT frame can lead to broker Out of Memory exception making it unresponsive.
CVE-2019-0223||While investigating bug PROTON-2014, we discovered that under some circumstances Apache Qpid Proton versions 0.9 to 0.27.0 (C library and its language bindings) can connect to a peer anonymously using TLS *even when configured to verify the peer certificate* while used with OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0. This means that an undetected man in the middle attack could be constructed if an attacker can arrange to intercept TLS traffic.
CVE-2019-0224||In Apache JSPWiki 2.9.0 to 2.11.0.M2, a carefully crafted URL could execute javascript on another user's session. No information could be saved on the server or jspwiki database, nor would an attacker be able to execute js on someone else's browser; only on its own browser.
CVE-2019-0225||A specially crafted url could be used to access files under the ROOT directory of the application on Apache JSPWiki 2.9.0 to 2.11.0.M2, which could be used by an attacker to obtain registered users' details.
CVE-2019-0226||Apache Karaf Config service provides a install method (via service or MBean) that could be used to travel in any directory and overwrite existing file. The vulnerability is low if the Karaf process user has limited permission on the filesystem. Any Apache Karaf version before 4.2.5 is impacted. User should upgrade to Apache Karaf 4.2.5 or later.

After leaving the loop, the network packet has a length of 2 bytes. There is no validation of this length. Later on, the code tries to read at an empty position, leading to a crash.
CVE-2019-10051||An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. If the function filetracker_newchunk encounters an unsafe "Some(sfcm) => { ft.new_chunk }" item, then the program enters an smb/files.rs error condition and crashes.
CVE-2019-10052||An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. If the network packet does not have the right length, the parser tries to access a part of a DHCP packet. At this point, the Rust environment runs into a panic in parse_clientid_option in the dhcp/parser.rs file.
CVE-2019-10053||An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.x before 4.1.4. If the input of the function SSHParseBanner is composed only of a \n character, then the program runs into a heap-based buffer over-read. This occurs because the erroneous search for \r results in an integer underflow.
CVE-2019-10054||An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. The function process_reply_record_v3 lacks a check for the length of reply.data. It causes an invalid memory access and the program crashes within the nfs/nfs3.rs file.
CVE-2019-10055||An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. The function ftp_pasv_response lacks a check for the length of part1 and part2, leading to a crash within the ftp/mod.rs file.
CVE-2019-10056||An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. The code mishandles the case of sending a network packet with the right type, such that the function DecodeEthernet in decode-ethernet.c is executed a second time. At this point, the algorithm cuts the first part of the packet and doesn't determine the current length. Specifically, if the packet is exactly 28 long, in the first iteration it subtracts 14 bytes. Then, it is working with a packet length of 14. At this point, the case distinction says it is a valid packet. After that it casts the packet, but this packet has no type, and the program crashes at the type case distinction.
CVE-2019-10057||Various Lexmark products have CSRF.

CVE-2019-10062||The HTMLSanitizer class in html-sanitizer.ts in all released versions of the Aurelia framework 1.x repository is vulnerable to XSS. The sanitizer only attempts to filter SCRIPT elements, which makes it feasible for remote attackers to conduct XSS attacks via (for example) JavaScript code in an attribute of various other elements. An attacker might also exploit a bug in how the SCRIPT string is processed by splitting and nesting them for example.
CVE-2019-10063||Flatpak before 1.0.8, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.4, and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 allows a sandbox bypass. Flatpak versions since 0.8.1 address CVE-2017-5226 by using a seccomp filter to prevent sandboxed apps from using the TIOCSTI ioctl, which could otherwise be used to inject commands into the controlling terminal so that they would be executed outside the sandbox after the sandboxed app exits. This fix was incomplete: on 64-bit platforms, the seccomp filter could be bypassed by an ioctl request number that has TIOCSTI in its 32 least significant bits and an arbitrary nonzero value in its 32 most significant bits, which the Linux kernel would treat as equivalent to TIOCSTI.
CVE-2019-10064||hostapd before 2.6, in EAP mode, makes calls to the rand() and random() standard library functions without any preceding srand() or srandom() call, which results in inappropriate use of deterministic values. This was fixed in conjunction with CVE-2016-10743.

CVE-2019-10082||In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18-2.4.39, using fuzzed network input, the http/2 session handling could be made to read memory after being freed, during connection shutdown.
CVE-2019-10083||When updating a Process Group via the API in NiFi versions 1.3.0 to 1.9.2, the response to the request includes all of its contents (at the top most level, not recursively). The response included details about processors and controller services which the user may not have had read access to.
CVE-2019-10084||In Apache Impala 2.7.0 to 3.2.0, an authenticated user with access to the IDs of active Impala queries or sessions can interact with those sessions or queries via a specially-constructed request and thereby potentially bypass authorization and audit mechanisms. Session and query IDs are unique and random, but have not been documented or consistently treated as sensitive secrets. Therefore they may be exposed in logs or interfaces. They were also not generated with a cryptographically secure random number generator, so are vulnerable to random number generator attacks that predict future IDs based on past IDs. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as an authenticated user.

CVE-2019-10638||In the Linux kernel before 5.1.7, a device can be tracked by an attacker using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). An attack may be conducted by hosting a crafted web page that uses WebRTC or gQUIC to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses.
CVE-2019-10639||The Linux kernel 4.x (starting from 4.1) and 5.x before 5.0.8 allows Information Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address associated with a network namespace.
CVE-2019-1064||An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows AppX Deployment Service (AppXSVC) improperly handles hard links, aka 'Windows Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.

CVE-2019-10647||ZZZCMS zzzphp v1.6.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a .php URL in the plugins/ueditor/php/controller.php?action=catchimage source[] parameter because of a lack of inc/zzz_file.php restrictions. For example, source%5B%5D=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.1%2Ftest.php can be used if the 192.168.0.1 web server sends the contents of a .php file (i.e., it does not interpret a .php file).
CVE-2019-10648||Robocode through 1.9.3.5 allows remote attackers to cause external service interaction (DNS), as demonstrated by a query for a unique subdomain name within an attacker-controlled DNS zone, because of a .openStream call within java.net.URL.

CVE-2019-10665||An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. The scripts that handle the graphing options (html/includes/graphs/common.inc.php and html/includes/graphs/graphs.inc.php) do not sufficiently validate or encode several fields of user supplied input. Some parameters are filtered with mysqli_real_escape_string, which is only useful for preventing SQL injection attacks; other parameters are unfiltered. This allows an attacker to inject RRDtool syntax with newline characters via the html/graph.php script. RRDtool syntax is quite versatile and an attacker could leverage this to perform a number of attacks, including disclosing directory structure and filenames, file content, denial of service, or writing arbitrary files.
CVE-2019-10666||An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. Several of the scripts perform dynamic script inclusion via the include() function on user supplied input without sanitizing the values by calling basename() or a similar function. An attacker can leverage this to execute PHP code from the included file. Exploitation of these scripts is made difficult by additional text being appended (typically .inc.php), which means an attacker would need to be able to control both a filename and its content on the server. However, exploitation can be achieved as demonstrated by the csv.php?report=../ substring.
CVE-2019-10667||An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. Information disclosure can occur: an attacker can fingerprint the exact code version installed and disclose local file paths.
CVE-2019-10668||An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. A number of scripts import the Authentication libraries, but do not enforce an actual authentication check. Several of these scripts disclose information or expose functions that are of a sensitive nature and are not expected to be publicly accessible.
CVE-2019-10669||An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. There is a command injection vulnerability in html/includes/graphs/device/collectd.inc.php where user supplied parameters are filtered with the mysqli_escape_real_string function. This function is not the appropriate function to sanitize command arguments as it does not escape a number of command line syntax characters such as ` (backtick), allowing an attacker to inject commands into the variable $rrd_cmd, which gets executed via passthru().
CVE-2019-1067||An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel fails to properly handle objects in memory, aka 'Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.
CVE-2019-10670||An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. Many of the scripts rely on the function mysqli_escape_real_string for filtering data. However, this is particularly ineffective when returning user supplied input in an HTML or a JavaScript context, resulting in unsafe data being injected into these contexts, leading to attacker controlled JavaScript executing in the browser. One example of this is the string parameter in html/pages/inventory.inc.php.
CVE-2019-10671||An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. It does not parameterize all user supplied input within database queries, resulting in SQL injection. An authenticated attacker can subvert these database queries to extract or manipulate data, as demonstrated by the graph.php sort parameter.
CVE-2019-10672||treeRead in hdf/btree.c in libmysofa before 0.7 does not properly validate multiplications and additions.
CVE-2019-10673||A CSRF vulnerability in a logged-in user's profile edit form in the Ultimate Member plugin before 2.0.40 for WordPress allows attackers to become admin and subsequently extract sensitive information and execute arbitrary code. This occurs because the attacker can change the e-mail address in the administrator profile, and then the attacker is able to reset the administrator password using the WordPress "password forget" form.
CVE-2019-10675||** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: none.
CVE-2019-10676||An issue was discovered in Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14. Upon entering new credentials to a site that is not registered within this product, a pop-up window will appear prompting the user if they want to save this new password. This pop-up window will persist on any page the user enters within the browser until a decision is made. The code of the pop-up window can be read by remote servers and contains the login credentials and URL in cleartext. A malicious server could easily grab this information from the pop-up. This is related to id="uniqkey-password-popup" and password-popup/popup.html.
CVE-2019-10677||Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues in the web interface on DASAN Zhone ZNID GPON 2426A EU version S3.1.285 devices allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript via manipulation of an unsanitized GET parameter: /zhndnsdisplay.cmd (name), /wlsecrefresh.wl (wlWscCfgMethod, wl_wsc_reg).

CVE-2019-11072||** DISPUTED ** lighttpd before 1.4.54 has a signed integer overflow, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malicious HTTP GET request, as demonstrated by mishandling of /%2F? in burl_normalize_2F_to_slash_fix in burl.c. NOTE: The developer states "The feature which can be abused to cause the crash is a new feature in lighttpd 1.4.50, and is not enabled by default. It must be explicitly configured in the config file (e.g. lighttpd.conf). Certain input will trigger an abort() in lighttpd when that feature is enabled. lighttpd detects the underflow or realloc() will fail (in both 32-bit and 64-bit executables), also detected in lighttpd. Either triggers an explicit abort() by lighttpd. This is not exploitable beyond triggering the explicit abort() with subsequent application exit."

CVE-2019-11185||The WP Live Chat Support Pro plugin through 8.0.26 for WordPress contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. This results from an incomplete patch for CVE-2018-12426. Arbitrary file upload is achieved by using a non-blacklisted executable file extension in conjunction with a whitelisted file extension, and prepending "magic bytes" to the payload to pass MIME checks. Specifically, an unauthenticated remote user submits a crafted file upload POST request to the REST api remote_upload endpoint. The file contains data that will fool the plugin's MIME check into classifying it as an image (which is a whitelisted file extension) and finally a trailing .phtml file extension.
CVE-2019-11187||Incorrect Access Control in the LDAP class of GONICUS GOsa through 2019-04-11 allows an attacker to log into any account with a username containing the case-insensitive substring "success" when an arbitrary password is provided.
CVE-2019-11189||Authentication Bypass by Spoofing in org.onosproject.acl (access control) and org.onosproject.mobility (host mobility) in ONOS v2.0 and earlier allows attackers to bypass network access control via data plane packet injection. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker sends a gratuitous ARP reply that causes the host mobility application to remove existing access control flow denial rules in the network. The access control application does not re-install flow deny rules, so the attacker can bypass the intended access control policy.
CVE-2019-1119||A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that DirectWrite handles objects in memory, aka 'DirectWrite Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2019-1117, CVE-2019-1118, CVE-2019-1120, CVE-2019-1121, CVE-2019-1122, CVE-2019-1123, CVE-2019-1124, CVE-2019-1127, CVE-2019-1128.
CVE-2019-11190||The Linux kernel before 4.8 allows local users to bypass ASLR on setuid programs (such as /bin/su) because install_exec_creds() is called too late in load_elf_binary() in fs/binfmt_elf.c, and thus the ptrace_may_access() check has a race condition when reading /proc/pid/stat.
CVE-2019-11191||** DISPUTED ** The Linux kernel through 5.0.7, when CONFIG_IA32_AOUT is enabled and ia32_aout is loaded, allows local users to bypass ASLR on setuid a.out programs (if any exist) because install_exec_creds() is called too late in load_aout_binary() in fs/binfmt_aout.c, and thus the ptrace_may_access() check has a race condition when reading /proc/pid/stat. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes that this is a vulnerability because ASLR for a.out format executables has never been supported.
CVE-2019-11193||The FileManager in InfinitumIT DirectAdmin through v1.561 has XSS via CMD_FILE_MANAGER, CMD_SHOW_USER, and CMD_SHOW_RESELLER; an attacker can bypass the CSRF protection with this, and take over the administration panel.

CVE-2019-11199||Dolibarr ERP/CRM 9.0.1 was affected by stored XSS within uploaded files. These vulnerabilities allowed the execution of a JavaScript payload each time any regular user or administrative user clicked on the malicious link hosted on the same domain. The vulnerabilities could be exploited by low privileged users to target administrators. The viewimage.php page did not perform any contextual output encoding and would display the content within the uploaded file with a user-requested MIME type.
CVE-2019-1120||A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that DirectWrite handles objects in memory, aka 'DirectWrite Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2019-1117, CVE-2019-1118, CVE-2019-1119, CVE-2019-1121, CVE-2019-1122, CVE-2019-1123, CVE-2019-1124, CVE-2019-1127, CVE-2019-1128.
CVE-2019-11200||Dolibarr ERP/CRM 9.0.1 provides a web-based functionality that backs up the database content to a dump file. However, the application performs insufficient checks on the export parameters to mysqldump, which can lead to execution of arbitrary binaries on the server. (Malicious binaries can be uploaded by abusing other functionalities of the application.)
CVE-2019-11201||Dolibarr ERP/CRM 9.0.1 provides a module named website that provides for creation of public websites with a WYSIWYG editor. It was identified that the editor also allowed inclusion of dynamic code, which can lead to code execution on the host machine. An attacker has to check a setting on the same page, which specifies the inclusion of dynamic content. Thus, a lower privileged user of the application can execute code under the context and permissions of the underlying web server.
CVE-2019-11202||An issue was discovered that affects the following versions of Rancher: v2.0.0 through v2.0.13, v2.1.0 through v2.1.8, and v2.2.0 through 2.2.1. When Rancher starts for the first time, it creates a default admin user with a well-known password. After initial setup, the Rancher administrator may choose to delete this default admin user. If Rancher is restarted, the default admin user will be recreated with the well-known default password. An attacker could exploit this by logging in with the default admin credentials. This can be mitigated by deactivating the default admin user rather than completing deleting them.

CVE-2019-1123||A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that DirectWrite handles objects in memory, aka 'DirectWrite Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2019-1117, CVE-2019-1118, CVE-2019-1119, CVE-2019-1120, CVE-2019-1121, CVE-2019-1122, CVE-2019-1124, CVE-2019-1127, CVE-2019-1128.
CVE-2019-11230||In Avast Antivirus before 19.4, a local administrator can trick the product into renaming arbitrary files by replacing the Logs\Update.log file with a symlink. The next time the product attempts to write to the log file, the target of the symlink is renamed. This defect can be exploited to rename a critical product file (e.g., AvastSvc.exe), causing the product to fail to start on the next system restart.
CVE-2019-11231||An issue was discovered in GetSimple CMS through 3.3.15. insufficient input sanitation in the theme-edit.php file allows upload of files with arbitrary content (PHP code, for example). This vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user; however, authentication can be bypassed. According to the official documentation for installation step 10, an admin is required to upload all the files, including the .htaccess files, and run a health check. However, what is overlooked is that the Apache HTTP Server by default no longer enables the AllowOverride directive, leading to data/users/admin.xml password exposure. The passwords are hashed but this can be bypassed by starting with the data/other/authorization.xml API key. This allows one to target the session state, since they decided to roll their own implementation. The cookie_name is crafted information that can be leaked from the frontend (site name and version). If a someone leaks the API key and the admin username, then they can bypass authentication. To do so, they need to supply a cookie based on an SHA-1 computation of this known information. The vulnerability exists in the admin/theme-edit.php file. This file checks for forms submissions via POST requests, and for the csrf nonce. If the nonce sent is correct, then the file provided by the user is uploaded. There is a path traversal allowing write access outside the jailed themes directory root. Exploiting the traversal is not necessary because the .htaccess file is ignored. A contributing factor is that there isn't another check on the extension before saving the file, with the assumption that the parameter content is safe. This allows the creation of web accessible and executable files with arbitrary content.
CVE-2019-11232||EXCELLENT INFOTEK BiYan v1.57 ~ v2.8 allows an attacker to leak user information (Password) without being authenticated, by sending an EMP_NO element to the kws_login/asp/query_user.asp URI, and then reading the PWD element.
CVE-2019-11233||EXCELLENT INFOTEK BiYan v1.57 ~ v2.8 allows an attacker to leak user information without being authenticated, by sending a LOGIN_ID element to the auth/main/asp/check_user_login_info.aspx URI, and then reading the response, as demonstrated by the KW_EMAIL or KW_TEL field.

CVE-2019-11246||The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes runs tar inside the container to create a tar archive, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the user’s machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the user’s machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. Kubernetes affected versions include versions prior to 1.12.9, versions prior to 1.13.6, versions prior to 1.14.2, and versions 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11.
CVE-2019-11247||The Kubernetes kube-apiserver mistakenly allows access to a cluster-scoped custom resource if the request is made as if the resource were namespaced. Authorizations for the resource accessed in this manner are enforced using roles and role bindings within the namespace, meaning that a user with access only to a resource in one namespace could create, view update or delete the cluster-scoped resource (according to their namespace role privileges). Kubernetes affected versions include versions prior to 1.13.9, versions prior to 1.14.5, versions prior to 1.15.2, and versions 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12.

Headers such as X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options are generally advisable, however some information security professionals additionally look for X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies and X-XSS-Protection, which are more generally applicable to HTML endpoint, to be included too. These headers were not included in Couchbase Server 5.5.0 and 5.1.2 . They are now included in version 6.0.2 in responses from the Couchbase Server Views REST API (port 8092).
CVE-2019-11465||An issue was discovered in Couchbase Server 5.5.x through 5.5.3 and 6.0.0. The Memcached "connections" stat block command emits a non-redacted username. The system information submitted to Couchbase as part of a bug report included the usernames for all users currently logged into the system even if the log was redacted for privacy. This has been fixed (in 5.5.4 and 6.0.1) so that usernames are tagged properly in the logs and are hashed out when the logs are redacted.
CVE-2019-11466||In Couchbase Server 6.0.0 and 5.5.0, the eventing service exposes system diagnostic profile via an HTTP endpoint that does not require credentials on a port earmarked for internal traffic only. This has been remedied in version 6.0.1 and now requires valid credentials to access.
CVE-2019-11467||In Couchbase Server 4.6.3 and 5.5.0, secondary indexing encodes the entries to be indexed using collatejson. When index entries contain certain characters like \t, <, >, it caused buffer overrun as encoded string would be much larger than accounted for, causing indexer service to crash and restart. This has been remedied in versions 5.1.2 and 5.5.2 to ensure buffer always grows as needed for any input.

CVE-2019-11516||An issue was discovered in the Bluetooth component of the Cypress (formerly owned by Broadcom) Wireless IoT codebase. Extended Inquiry Responses (EIRs) are improperly handled, which causes a heap-based buffer overflow during device inquiry. This overflow can be used to overwrite existing functions with arbitrary code. The Reserved for Future Use (RFU) bits are not discarded by eir_handleRx(), and are included in an EIR's length. Therefore, one can exceed the expected 240 bytes, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in eir_getReceivedEIR() called by bthci_event_SendInquiryResultEvent(). In order to exploit this bug, an attacker must repeatedly connect to the victim's device in a short amount of time from different source addresses. This will cause the victim's Bluetooth stack to resolve the device names and therefore allocate buffers with attacker-controlled data. Due to the heap corruption, the name will be eventually written to an attacker-controlled location, leading to a write-what-where condition.
CVE-2019-11517||WampServer before 3.1.9 has CSRF in add_vhost.php because the synchronizer pattern implemented as remediation of CVE-2018-8817 was incomplete. An attacker could add/delete any vhosts without the consent of the owner.

CVE-2019-11747||The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an http: URL rather than secure https: they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.
CVE-2019-11748||WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.
CVE-2019-11749||A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the getUserMedia API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

CVE-2019-11840||An issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography libraries, aka golang-googlecode-go-crypto, before 2019-03-20. A flaw was found in the amd64 implementation of golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20 and golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20/salsa. If more than 256 GiB of keystream is generated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits, the amd64 implementation will first generate incorrect output, and then cycle back to previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can lead to loss of confidentiality in encryption applications, or to predictability in CSPRNG applications.
CVE-2019-11841||A message-forgery issue was discovered in crypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go in supplementary Go cryptography libraries 2019-03-25. According to the OpenPGP Message Format specification in RFC 4880 chapter 7, a cleartext signed message can contain one or more optional "Hash" Armor Headers. The "Hash" Armor Header specifies the message digest algorithm(s) used for the signature. However, the Go clearsign package ignores the value of this header, which allows an attacker to spoof it. Consequently, an attacker can lead a victim to believe the signature was generated using a different message digest algorithm than what was actually used. Moreover, since the library skips Armor Header parsing in general, an attacker can not only embed arbitrary Armor Headers, but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages without invalidating the signatures.

CVE-2019-11875||In AutomateAppCore.dll in Blue Prism Robotic Process Automation 6.4.0.8445, a vulnerability in access control can be exploited to escalate privileges. The vulnerability allows for abusing the application for fraud or unauthorized access to certain information. The attack requires a valid user account to connect to the Blue Prism server, but the roles associated to this account are not required to have any permissions. First of all, the application files are modified to grant full permissions on the client side. In a test environment (or his own instance of the software) an attacker is able to grant himself full privileges also on the server side. He can then, for instance, create a process with malicious behavior and export it to disk. With the modified client, it is possible to import the exported file as a release and overwrite any existing process in the database. Eventually, the bots execute the malicious process. The server does not check the user's permissions for the aforementioned actions, such that a modification of the client software enables this kind of attack. Possible scenarios may involve changing bank accounts or setting passwords.

CVE-2019-12017||A remote code execution vulnerability exists in MapR CLDB code, specifically in the JSON framework that is used in the CLDB code that handles login and ticket issuance. An attacker can use the 'class' property of the JSON request sent to the CLDB to influence the JSON library's decision on which Java class this JSON request is deserialized to. By doing so, the attacker can force the MapR CLDB to construct a URLClassLoader which loads a malicious Java class from a remote path and instantiate this object in the MapR CLDB, thus executing arbitrary code on the machine running the MapR CLDB and take over the cluster. By switching to the newer Jackson library and ensuring that all incoming JSON requests are only deserialized to the same class that it was serialized from, the vulnerability is fixed. This vulnerability affects the entire MapR core platform.
