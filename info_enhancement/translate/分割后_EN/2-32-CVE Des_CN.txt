CVE-2017-11129||An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android. The keystore is locked with a hard-coded password. Therefore, everyone with access to the keystore can read the content out, for example the private key of the user.
CVE-2017-1113||IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session. IBM X-Force ID: 121151.
CVE-2017-11130||An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The product's protocol only tries to ensure confidentiality. In the whole protocol, no integrity or authenticity checks are done. Therefore man-in-the-middle attackers can conduct replay attacks.
CVE-2017-11131||An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. For authentication, the user password is hashed directly with SHA-512 without a salt or another key-derivation mechanism to enable a secure secret for authentication. Moreover, only the first 32 bytes of the hash are used. This allows for easy dictionary and rainbow-table attacks if an attacker has access to the password hash.
CVE-2017-11132||An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat before 1.5.18 for Android. No certificate pinning is implemented; therefore the attacker could issue a certificate for the backend and the application would not notice it.
CVE-2017-11133||An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. To encrypt messages, AES in CBC mode is used with a pseudo-random secret. This secret and the IV are generated with math.random() in previous versions and with CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random() in newer versions, which uses math.random() internally. This is not cryptographically strong.
CVE-2017-11134||An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android. The login credentials are written into a log file on the device. Hence, an attacker with access to the logs can read them.
CVE-2017-11135||An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore, an attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial of service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in customer-controlled software, in the sense that the StashCat client side has no secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that data should be deleted.
CVE-2017-11136||An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. It uses RSA to exchange a secret for symmetric encryption of messages. However, the private RSA key is not only stored on the client but transmitted to the backend, too. Moreover, the key to decrypt the private key is composed of the first 32 bytes of the SHA-512 hash of the user password. But this hash is stored on the backend, too. Therefore, everyone with access to the backend database can read the transmitted secret for symmetric encryption, hence can read the communication.

CVE-2017-11578||It was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in the most recent firmware for Blipcare device that the device allows to connect to web management interface on a non-SSL connection using plain text HTTP protocol. The user uses the web management interface of the device to provide the user's Wi-Fi credentials so that the device can connect to it and have Internet access. This device acts as a Wireless Blood pressure monitor and is used to measure blood pressure levels of a person. This allows an attacker who is connected to the Blipcare's device wireless network to easily sniff these values using a MITM attack.
CVE-2017-11579||In the most recent firmware for Blipcare, the device provides an open Wireless network called "Blip" for communicating with the device. The user connects to this open Wireless network and uses the web management interface of the device to provide the user's Wi-Fi credentials so that the device can connect to it and have Internet access. This device acts as a Wireless Blood pressure monitor and is used to measure blood pressure levels of a person. This allows an attacker who is in vicinity of Wireless signal generated by the Blipcare device to easily sniff the credentials. Also, an attacker can connect to the open wireless network "Blip" exposed by the device and modify the HTTP response presented to the user by the device to execute other attacks such as convincing the user to download and execute a malicious binary that would infect a user's computer or mobile device with malware.
CVE-2017-11580||Blipcare Wifi blood pressure monitor BP700 10.1 devices allow memory corruption that results in Denial of Service. When connected to the "Blip" open wireless connection provided by the device, if a large string is sent as a part of the HTTP request in any part of the HTTP headers, the device could become completely unresponsive. Presumably this happens as the memory footprint provided to this device is very small. According to the specs from Rezolt, the Wi-Fi module only has 256k of memory. As a result, an incorrect string copy operation using either memcpy, strcpy, or any of their other variants could result in filling up the memory space allocated to the function executing and this would result in memory corruption. To test the theory, one can modify the demo application provided by the Cypress WICED SDK and introduce an incorrect "memcpy" operation and use the compiled application on the evaluation board provided by Cypress semiconductors with exactly the same Wi-Fi SOC. The results were identical where the device would completely stop responding to any of the ping or web requests.

CVE-2017-12622||When an Apache Geode cluster before v1.3.0 is operating in secure mode and an authenticated user connects to a Geode cluster using the gfsh tool with HTTP, the user is able to obtain status information and control cluster members even without CLUSTER:MANAGE privileges.
CVE-2017-12623||An authorized user could upload a template which contained malicious code and accessed sensitive files via an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. The fix to properly handle XML External Entities was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.4.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.
CVE-2017-12624||Apache CXF supports sending and receiving attachments via either the JAX-WS or JAX-RS specifications. It is possible to craft a message attachment header that could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on a CXF web service provider. Both JAX-WS and JAX-RS services are vulnerable to this attack. From Apache CXF 3.2.1 and 3.1.14, message attachment headers that are greater than 300 characters will be rejected by default. This value is configurable via the property "attachment-max-header-size".
CVE-2017-12625||Apache Hive 2.1.x before 2.1.2, 2.2.x before 2.2.1, and 2.3.x before 2.3.1 expose an interface through which masking policies can be defined on tables or views, e.g., using Apache Ranger. When a view is created over a given table, the policy enforcement does not happen correctly on the table for masked columns.
CVE-2017-12626||Apache POI in versions prior to release 3.17 are vulnerable to Denial of Service Attacks: 1) Infinite Loops while parsing crafted WMF, EMF, MSG and macros (POI bugs 61338 and 61294), and 2) Out of Memory Exceptions while parsing crafted DOC, PPT and XLS (POI bugs 52372 and 61295).
CVE-2017-12627||In Apache Xerces-C XML Parser library before 3.2.1, processing of external DTD paths can result in a null pointer dereference under certain conditions.
CVE-2017-12628||The JMX server embedded in Apache James, also used by the command line client is exposed to a java de-serialization issue, and thus can be used to execute arbitrary commands. As James exposes JMX socket by default only on local-host, this vulnerability can only be used for privilege escalation. Release 3.0.1 upgrades the incriminated library.
CVE-2017-12629||Remote code execution occurs in Apache Solr before 7.1 with Apache Lucene before 7.1 by exploiting XXE in conjunction with use of a Config API add-listener command to reach the RunExecutableListener class. Elasticsearch, although it uses Lucene, is NOT vulnerable to this. Note that the XML external entity expansion vulnerability occurs in the XML Query Parser which is available, by default, for any query request with parameters deftype=xmlparser and can be exploited to upload malicious data to the /upload request handler or as Blind XXE using ftp wrapper in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server. Note also that the second vulnerability relates to remote code execution using the RunExecutableListener available on all affected versions of Solr.
CVE-2017-12630||In Apache Drill 1.11.0 and earlier when submitting form from Query page users are able to pass arbitrary script or HTML which will take effect on Profile page afterwards. Example: after submitting special script that returns cookie information from Query page, malicious user may obtain this information from Profile page afterwards.
CVE-2017-12631||Apache CXF Fediz ships with a number of container-specific plugins to enable WS-Federation for applications. A CSRF (Cross Style Request Forgery) style vulnerability has been found in the Spring 2, Spring 3 and Spring 4 plugins in versions before 1.4.3 and 1.3.3. The vulnerability can result in a security context that is set up using a malicious client's roles for the given enduser.
CVE-2017-12632||A malicious host header in an incoming HTTP request could cause NiFi to load resources from an external server. The fix to sanitize host headers and compare to a controlled whitelist was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.5.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.
CVE-2017-12633||The camel-hessian component in Apache Camel 2.x before 2.19.4 and 2.20.x before 2.20.1 is vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws.
CVE-2017-12634||The camel-castor component in Apache Camel 2.x before 2.19.4 and 2.20.x before 2.20.1 is vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws.
CVE-2017-12635||Due to differences in the Erlang-based JSON parser and JavaScript-based JSON parser, it is possible in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to submit _users documents with duplicate keys for 'roles' used for access control within the database, including the special case '_admin' role, that denotes administrative users. In combination with CVE-2017-12636 (Remote Code Execution), this can be used to give non-admin users access to arbitrary shell commands on the server as the database system user. The JSON parser differences result in behaviour that if two 'roles' keys are available in the JSON, the second one will be used for authorising the document write, but the first 'roles' key is used for subsequent authorization for the newly created user. By design, users can not assign themselves roles. The vulnerability allows non-admin users to give themselves admin privileges.
CVE-2017-12636||CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via HTTP(S). Some of the configuration options include paths for operating system-level binaries that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This allows an admin user in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to execute arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user, including downloading and executing scripts from the public internet.
