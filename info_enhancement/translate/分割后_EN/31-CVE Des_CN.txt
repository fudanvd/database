CVE-2016-8744||Apache Brooklyn uses the SnakeYAML library for parsing YAML inputs. SnakeYAML allows the use of YAML tags to indicate that SnakeYAML should unmarshal data to a Java type. In the default configuration in Brooklyn before 0.10.0, SnakeYAML will allow unmarshalling to any Java type available on the classpath. This could provide an authenticated user with a means to cause the JVM running Brooklyn to load and run Java code without detection by Brooklyn. Such code would have the privileges of the Java process running Brooklyn, including the ability to open files and network connections, and execute system commands. There is known to be a proof-of-concept exploit using this vulnerability.
CVE-2016-8745||A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 and 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 resulted in the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat versions.

CVE-2016-9458||** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: The CNA or individual who requested this candidate did not associate it with any vulnerability during 2016. Notes: none.
CVE-2016-9459||Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are vulnerable to a log pollution vulnerability potentially leading to a local XSS. The download log functionality in the admin screen is delivering the log in JSON format to the end-user. The file was delivered with an attachment disposition forcing the browser to download the document. However, Firefox running on Microsoft Windows would offer the user to open the data in the browser as an HTML document. Thus any injected data in the log would be executed.
CVE-2016-9460||Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are vulnerable to a content-spoofing attack in the files app. The location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.
CVE-2016-9461||Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not properly verifying edit check permissions on WebDAV copy actions. The WebDAV endpoint was not properly checking the permission on a WebDAV COPY action. This allowed an authenticated attacker with access to a read-only share to put new files in there. It was not possible to modify existing files.
CVE-2016-9462||Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not properly verifying restore privileges when restoring a file. The restore capability of Nextcloud/ownCloud was not verifying whether a user has only read-only access to a share. Thus a user with read-only access was able to restore old versions.
CVE-2016-9463||Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.1.2, 9.0.6, and 8.2.9 suffer from SMB User Authentication Bypass. Nextcloud/ownCloud include an optional and not by default enabled SMB authentication component that allows authenticating users against an SMB server. This backend is implemented in a way that tries to connect to a SMB server and if that succeeded consider the user logged-in. The backend did not properly take into account SMB servers that have any kind of anonymous auth configured. This is the default on SMB servers nowadays and allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to an account without valid credentials. Note: The SMB backend is disabled by default and requires manual configuration in the Nextcloud/ownCloud config file. If you have not configured the SMB backend then you're not affected by this vulnerability.
CVE-2016-9464||Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.0 suffers from an improper authorization check on removing shares. The Sharing Backend as implemented in Nextcloud does differentiate between shares to users and groups. In case of a received group share, users should be able to unshare the file to themselves but not to the whole group. The previous API implementation simply unshared the file to all users in the group.
CVE-2016-9465||Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from Stored XSS in CardDAV image export. The CardDAV image export functionality as implemented in Nextcloud/ownCloud allows the download of images stored within a vCard. Due to not performing any kind of verification on the image content this is prone to a stored Cross-Site Scripting attack.
CVE-2016-9466||Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from Reflected XSS in the Gallery application. The gallery app was not properly sanitizing exception messages from the Nextcloud/ownCloud server. Due to an endpoint where an attacker could influence the error message, this led to a reflected Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability.
CVE-2016-9467||Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from content spoofing in the files app. The location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.
CVE-2016-9468||Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from content spoofing in the dav app. The exception message displayed on the DAV endpoints contained partially user-controllable input leading to a potential misrepresentation of information.
CVE-2016-9469||Multiple versions of GitLab expose a dangerous method to any authenticated user that could lead to the deletion of all Issue and MergeRequest objects on a GitLab instance. For GitLab instances with publicly available projects this vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated user. A fix was included in versions 8.14.3, 8.13.8, and 8.12.11, which were released on December 5th 2016 at 3:59 PST. The GitLab versions vulnerable to this are 8.13.0, 8.13.0-ee, 8.13.1, 8.13.1-ee, 8.13.2, 8.13.2-ee, 8.13.3, 8.13.3-ee, 8.13.4, 8.13.4-ee, 8.13.5, 8.13.5-ee, 8.13.6, 8.13.6-ee, 8.13.7, 8.14.0, 8.14.0-ee, 8.14.1, 8.14.2, and 8.14.2-ee.
CVE-2016-9470||Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Reflected File Download. `www/delivery/asyncspc.php` was vulnerable to the fairly new Reflected File Download (RFD) web attack vector that enables attackers to gain complete control over a victim's machine by virtually downloading a file from a trusted domain.
CVE-2016-9471||Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Special Element Injection. Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver.
CVE-2016-9472||Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Reflected XSS. The Revive Adserver web installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the dbHost, dbUser, and possibly other parameters. It has to be noted that the window for such attack vectors to be possible is extremely narrow and it is very unlikely that such an attack could be actually effective.
CVE-2016-9473||Brave Browser iOS before 1.2.18 and Brave Browser Android 1.9.56 and earlier suffer from Full Address Bar Spoofing, allowing attackers to trick a victim by displaying a malicious page for legitimate domain names.

CVE-2016-9482||Code generated by PHP FormMail Generator may allow a remote unauthenticated user to bypass authentication in the to access the administrator panel by navigating directly to /admin.php?mod=admin&func=panel
CVE-2016-9483||The PHP form code generated by PHP FormMail Generator deserializes untrusted input as part of the phpfmg_filman_download() function. A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to use this vulnerability to inject PHP code, or along with CVE-2016-9484 to perform local file inclusion attacks and obtain files from the server.
CVE-2016-9484||The generated PHP form code does not properly validate user input folder directories, allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform a path traversal and access arbitrary files on the server. The PHP FormMail Generator website does not use version numbers and is updated continuously. Any PHP form code generated by this website prior to 2016-12-06 may be vulnerable.
CVE-2016-9485||On Windows endpoints, the SecureConnector agent must run under the local SYSTEM account or another administrator account in order to enable full functionality of the agent. The typical configuration is for the agent to run as a Windows service under the local SYSTEM account. The SecureConnector agent runs various plugin scripts and executables on the endpoint in order to gather and report information about the host to the CounterACT management appliance. The SecureConnector agent downloads these scripts and executables as needed from the CounterACT management appliance and runs them on the endpoint. The SecureConnector agent fails to set any permissions on downloaded file objects. This allows a malicious user to take ownership of any of these files and make modifications to it, regardless of where the files are saved. These files are then executed under SYSTEM privileges. A malicious unprivileged user can overwrite these executable files with malicious code before the SecureConnector agent executes them, causing the malicious code to be run under the SYSTEM account.
CVE-2016-9486||On Windows endpoints, the SecureConnector agent must run under the local SYSTEM account or another administrator account in order to enable full functionality of the agent. The typical configuration is for the agent to run as a Windows service under the local SYSTEM account. The SecureConnector agent runs various plugin scripts and executables on the endpoint in order to gather and report information about the host to the CounterACT management appliance. The SecureConnector agent downloads these scripts and executables as needed from the CounterACT management appliance and runs them on the endpoint. By default, these executable files are downloaded to and run from the %TEMP% directory of the currently logged on user, despite the fact that the SecureConnector agent is running as SYSTEM. Aside from the downloaded scripts, the SecureConnector agent runs a batch file with SYSTEM privileges from the temp directory of the currently logged on user. If the naming convention of this script can be derived, which is made possible by placing it in a directory to which the user has read access, it may be possible overwrite the legitimate batch file with a malicious one before SecureConnector executes it. It is possible to change this directory by setting the the configuration property config.script_run_folder.value in the local.properties configuration file on the CounterACT management appliance, however the batch file which is run does not follow this property.

CVE-2016-9553||The Sophos Web Appliance (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php (/controllers/MgrReport.php) component responsible for blocking and unblocking IP addresses from accessing the device. The device doesn't properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip' and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec() function which allows for system commands to be injected into the device. The code erroneously suggests that the information handled is protected by utilizing the variable name 'escapedips' - however this was not the case. The Sophos ID is NSWA-1258.
CVE-2016-9554||The Sophos Web Appliance Remote / Secure Web Gateway server (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the component responsible for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX wget utility. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'url' variable before calling the executeCommand class function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec() with unsanitized user input allowing for remote command injection. The page that contains the vulnerabilities, /controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php, is accessed by a built-in command answered by the administrative interface. The command that calls to that vulnerable page (passed in the 'section' parameter) is: 'configuration'. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the 'spiderman' user account.

CVE-2016-9878||An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Framework before 3.2.18, 4.2.x before 4.2.9, and 4.3.x before 4.3.5. Paths provided to the ResourceServlet were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks.
CVE-2016-9879||An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Security before 3.2.10, 4.1.x before 4.1.4, and 4.2.x before 4.2.1. Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded "/" to a request, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed. Users of Apache Tomcat (all current versions) are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value returned by getContextPath(), getServletPath(), and getPathInfo(). Users of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified. Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.x are known to be affected. Users of other containers that implement the Servlet specification may be affected.

CVE-2016-9937||An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.12.x and 13.13.x before 13.13.1 and 14.x before 14.2.1. If an SDP offer or answer is received with the Opus codec and with the format parameters separated using a space the code responsible for parsing will recursively call itself until it crashes. This occurs as the code does not properly handle spaces separating the parameters. This does NOT require the endpoint to have Opus configured in Asterisk. This also does not require the endpoint to be authenticated. If guest is enabled for chan_sip or anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP offer or answer is still processed and the crash occurs.
CVE-2016-9938||An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 11.x before 11.25.1, 13.x before 13.13.1, and 14.x before 14.2.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert16 and 13.x before 13.8-cert4. The chan_sip channel driver has a liberal definition for whitespace when attempting to strip the content between a SIP header name and a colon character. Rather than following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character as if it were whitespace. This means that headers such as Contact\x01: will be seen as a valid Contact header. This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request into Asterisk without authentication since it believes the request is an in-dialog request. However, because of the bug described above, the request will look like an out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then process the request as a new call. The result is that Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources without any authentication. If you do not use a proxy for authentication, then this issue does not affect you. If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track of what dialogs are currently valid), then this issue does not affect you. If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does not affect you.
CVE-2016-9939||Crypto++ (aka cryptopp and libcrypto++) 5.6.4 contained a bug in its ASN.1 BER decoding routine. The library will allocate a memory block based on the length field of the ASN.1 object.
