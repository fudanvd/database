NOTE: the original disclosure suggests that command injection is not feasible because the injection occurs after an "ORDER BY" clause, but it is likely that this bug could result in an error message path disclosure due to a syntax error, in some environments.  Therefore this is an exposure and should be included in CVE.

CVE-2005-4449||verify.php in FlatNuke 2.5.6 allows remote authenticated administrators to modify arbitrary PHP files by setting the file parameter to an arbitrary file and injecting the code into the body parameter.  NOTE: if a FlatNuke administrator is normally assumed to be able to modify arbitrary content, then this issue does not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.

NOTE: the wp-admin/menu-header.php vector is already covered by CVE-2005-2110. NOTE: the vars.php, edit-form.php, wp-settings.php, and edit-form-comment.php vectors were also reported to affect WordPress 2.0.1.
CVE-2005-4464||Ingate Firewall before 4.3.4 and SIParator before 4.3.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock) by sending a SYN packet for a TCP stream, which requires an RST packet in response.

NOTE: it is not clear whether this problem can be exploited for code execution. If not, then perhaps the user-assisted nature of the attack should exclude the issue from inclusion in CVE.

NOTE: the vendor has disputed this vulnerability, stating that the "XSS flaw was only part of the custom implementation of the [polopoly] site".  As of 20061003, CVE has no further information on this issue, except that the original researcher has a history of testing live sites and assuming that discoveries indicate vulnerabilities in the associated package.

NOTE: on 20060227, the vendor disputed the accuracy of this report, saying that the p_news_id, news_and_events_new.asp, and news.asp are not specifically part of their product, although they could be dynamically generated through use of the product.  Some investigation by CVE suggests evidence that the news_and_events_new.asp page has at least a forced invalid SQL syntax error, but this could not be repeated for news.asp.

NOTE: the vendor has stated that this problem could not be reproduced, and has asked the researcher for more information, without a response as of 20060103.
CVE-2005-4515||** DISPUTED **  SQL injection vulnerability in WebDB 1.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified search parameters, possibly Search0.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that "WebDB is a generic online database system used by many of the clients of Lois Software.

A technology like this cannot be susceptible to client-side cross-site-scripting-attacks on its own, but only applications created based on such a technology. This does not only apply to Lighthouse, but also to Perl, PHP or web applications based on Java Servlet technology."  Since the original researcher is known to test demo pages and is sometimes inaccurate, it is likely that this issue will be REJECTED.

CVE-2006-1542||Stack-based buffer overflow in Python 2.4.2 and earlier, running on Linux 2.6.12.5 under gcc 4.0.3 with libc 2.3.5, allows local users to cause a "stack overflow," and possibly gain privileges, by running a script from a current working directory that has a long name, related to the realpath function.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability. However, the fact that it appears in a programming language interpreter could mean that some applications are affected, although attack scenarios might be limited because the attacker might already need to cross privilege boundaries to cause an exploitable program to be placed in a directory with a long name; or, depending on the method that Python uses to determine the current working directory, setuid applications might be affected.
