CVE-2019-25017||An issue was discovered in rcp in MIT krb5-appl through 1.0.3. Due to the rcp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rcp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious rcp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rcp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file). This issue is similar to CVE-2019-6111 and CVE-2019-7283. NOTE: MIT krb5-appl is not supported upstream but is shipped by a few Linux distributions.

CVE-2019-3822||libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function creating an outgoing NTLM type-3 header (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message()`), generates the request HTTP header contents based on previously received data. The check that exists to prevent the local buffer from getting overflowed is implemented wrongly (using unsigned math) and as such it does not prevent the overflow from happening. This output data can grow larger than the local buffer if very large 'nt response' data is extracted from a previous NTLMv2 header provided by the malicious or broken HTTP server. Such a 'large value' needs to be around 1000 bytes or more. The actual payload data copied to the target buffer comes from the NTLMv2 type-2 response header.
CVE-2019-3823||libcurl versions from 7.34.0 to before 7.64.0 are vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds read in the code handling the end-of-response for SMTP. If the buffer passed to `smtp_endofresp()` isn't NUL terminated and contains no character ending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5, then the `strtol()` call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents will not be returned to the caller.

CVE-2019-3969||Comodo Antivirus versions up to 12.0.0.6810 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation due to CmdAgent's handling of COM clients. A local process can bypass the signature check enforced by CmdAgent via process hollowing which can then allow the process to invoke sensitive COM methods in CmdAgent such as writing to the registry with SYSTEM privileges.
CVE-2019-3970||Comodo Antivirus versions up to 12.0.0.6810 are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write due to Cavwp.exe handling of Comodo's Antivirus database. Cavwp.exe loads Comodo antivirus definition database in unsecured global section objects, allowing a local low privileged process to modify this data directly and change virus signatures.
CVE-2019-3971||Comodo Antivirus versions up to 12.0.0.6810 are vulnerable to a local Denial of Service affecting CmdVirth.exe via its LPC port "cmdvrtLPCServerPort". A low privileged local process can connect to this port and send an LPC_DATAGRAM, which triggers an Access Violation due to hardcoded NULLs used for Source parameter in a memcpy operation that is called for this handler. This results in CmdVirth.exe and its child svchost.exe instances to terminate.
CVE-2019-3972||Comodo Antivirus versions 12.0.0.6810 and below are vulnerable to Denial of Service affecting CmdAgent.exe via an unprotected section object "<GUID>_CisSharedMemBuff". This section object is exposed by CmdAgent and contains a SharedMemoryDictionary object, which allows a low privileged process to modify the object data causing CmdAgent.exe to crash.
CVE-2019-3973||Comodo Antivirus versions 11.0.0.6582 and below are vulnerable to Denial of Service affecting CmdGuard.sys via its filter port "cmdServicePort". A low privileged process can crash CmdVirth.exe to decrease the port's connection count followed by process hollowing a CmdVirth.exe instance with malicious code to obtain a handle to "cmdServicePort". Once this occurs, a specially crafted message can be sent to "cmdServicePort" using "FilterSendMessage" API. This can trigger an out-of-bounds write if lpOutBuffer parameter in FilterSendMessage API is near the end of specified buffer bounds. The crash occurs when the driver performs a memset operation which uses a size beyond the size of buffer specified, causing kernel crash.
