CVE-2020-9450||An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510. anti_ransomware_service.exe exposes a REST API that can be used by everyone, even unprivileged users. This API is used to communicate from the GUI to anti_ransomware_service.exe. This can be exploited to add an arbitrary malicious executable to the whitelist, or even exclude an entire drive from being monitored by anti_ransomware_service.exe.
CVE-2020-9451||An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510. anti_ransomware_service.exe keeps a log in a folder where unprivileged users have write permissions. The logs are generated in a predictable pattern, allowing an unprivileged user to create a hardlink from a (not yet created) log file to anti_ransomware_service.exe. On reboot, this forces the anti_ransomware_service to try to write its log into its own process, crashing in a SHARING VIOLATION. This crash occurs on every reboot.
CVE-2020-9452||An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510. anti_ransomware_service.exe includes functionality to quarantine files by copying a suspected ransomware file from one directory to another using SYSTEM privileges. Because unprivileged users have write permissions in the quarantine folder, it is possible to control this privileged write with a hardlink. This means that an unprivileged user can write/overwrite arbitrary files in arbitrary folders. Escalating privileges to SYSTEM is trivial with arbitrary writes. While the quarantine feature is not enabled by default, it can be forced to copy the file to the quarantine by communicating with anti_ransomware_service.exe through its REST API.

CVE-2021-0207||An improper interpretation conflict of certain data between certain software components within the Juniper Networks Junos OS devices does not allow certain traffic to pass through the device upon receipt from an ingress interface filtering certain specific types of traffic which is then being redirected to an egress interface on a different VLAN. This causes a Denial of Service (DoS) to those clients sending these particular types of traffic. Such traffic being sent by a client may appear genuine, but is non-standard in nature and should be considered as potentially malicious, and can be targeted to the device, or destined through it for the issue to occur. This issues affects IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. An indicator of compromise may be found by checking log files. You may find that traffic on the input interface has 100% of traffic flowing into the device, yet the egress interface shows 0 pps leaving the device. For example: [show interfaces "interface" statistics detail] Output between two interfaces would reveal something similar to: Ingress, first interface: -------------------- Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/0 Up 9999999999 (9999) 1 (0) -------------------- Egress, second interface: -------------------- Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/1 Up 0 (0) 9999999999 (0) -------------------- Dropped packets will not show up in DDoS monitoring/protection counters as issue is not caused by anti-DDoS protection mechanisms.

CVE-2021-0222||A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the device by sending certain crafted protocol packets from an adjacent device with invalid payloads to the device. These crafted packets, which should be discarded, are instead replicated and sent to the RE. Over time, a Denial of Service (DoS) occurs. Continued receipt of these crafted protocol packets will cause an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition, which may cause wider traffic impact due to protocol flapping.

CVE-2021-0293||A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS caused by Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime leads to a memory leak each time the CLI command 'show system connections extensive' is executed. The amount of memory leaked on each execution depends on the number of TCP connections from and to the system. Repeated execution will cause more memory to leak and eventually daemons that need to allocate additionally memory and ultimately the kernel to crash, which will result in traffic loss. Continued execution of this command will cause a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An administrator can use the following CLI command to monitor for increase in memory consumption of the netstat process, if it exists: user@junos> show system processes extensive | match "username|netstat" PID USERNAME PRI NICE SIZE RES STATE C TIME WCPU COMMAND 21181 root 100 0 5458M 4913M CPU3 2 0:59 97.27% netstat The following log message might be observed if this issue happens: kernel: %KERN-3: pid 21181 (netstat), uid 0, was killed: out of swap space This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S8, 18.2R3-S7. 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S6, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S6, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S4; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S1; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S3, 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S1, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R1-S1, 20.3R2; This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.2R1.
CVE-2021-0294||A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS, which only affects the release 18.4R2-S5, where a function is inconsistently implemented on Juniper Networks Junos QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series, and if "storm-control enhanced" is configured, can lead to the enhanced storm control filter group not be installed. It will cause storm control not to work hence allowing an attacker to cause high CPU usage or packet loss issues by sending a large amount of broadcast or unknown unicast packets arriving the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks QFX5100, QFX5110, QFX5120, QFX5200, QFX5210, EX4600, and EX4650, and QFX5100 with QFX 5e Series image installed. QFX5130 and QFX5220 are not affected from this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 18.4R2-S5 on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series. No other product or platform is affected by this vulnerability.
CVE-2021-0295||A vulnerability in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on the QFX10K Series switches allows an attacker to trigger a packet forwarding loop, leading to a partial Denial of Service (DoS). The issue is caused by DVMRP packets looping on a multi-homed Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) when VXLAN is configured. DVMRP packets received on a multi-homed ESI are sent to the peer, and then incorrectly forwarded out the same ESI, violating the split horizon rule. This issue only affects QFX10K Series switches, including the QFX10002, QFX10008, and QFX10016. Other products and platforms are unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX10K Series: 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S12; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R3-S5; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S13; 18.2 version 18.2R1 and later versions; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S8; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2.
CVE-2021-0296||The Juniper Networks CTPView server is not enforcing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). HSTS is an optional response header which allows servers to indicate that content from the requested domain will only be served over HTTPS. The lack of HSTS may leave the system vulnerable to downgrade attacks, SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle attacks, and weakens cookie-hijacking protections. This issue affects Juniper Networks CTPView: 7.3 versions prior to 7.3R7; 9.1 versions prior to 9.1R3.
CVE-2021-0297||A vulnerability in the processing of TCP MD5 authentication in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a BGP or LDP session configured with MD5 authentication to succeed, even if the peer does not have TCP MD5 authentication enabled. This could lead to untrusted or unauthorized sessions being established, resulting in an impact on confidentiality or stability of the network. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.3R2-S1-EVO; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-EVO; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO. Juniper Networks Junos OS is not affected by this issue.
CVE-2021-0298||A Race Condition in the 'show chassis pic' command in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow an attacker to crash the port interface concentrator daemon (picd) process on the FPC, if the command is executed coincident with other system events outside the attacker's control, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued execution of the CLI command, under precise conditions, could create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects all Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.1R2-EVO on PTX10003 and PTX10008 platforms. Junos OS is not affected by this vulnerability.
CVE-2021-0299||An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the processing of a transit or directly received malformed IPv6 packet in Juniper Networks Junos OS results in a kernel crash, causing the device to restart, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects systems with IPv6 configured. Devices with only IPv4 configured are not vulnerable to this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R1-S1, 20.2R2.

CVE-2021-0942||The path in this case is a little bit convoluted.
