CVE-2020-15213||In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using segment sum can trigger a denial of service by causing an out of memory allocation in the implementation of segment sum. Since code uses the last element of the tensor holding them to determine the dimensionality of output tensor, attackers can use a very large value to trigger a large allocation. The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to limit the maximum value in the segment ids tensor. This only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model, but a similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime, between inference steps. However, if the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.
CVE-2020-15214||In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using segment sum can trigger a write out bounds / segmentation fault if the segment ids are not sorted. Code assumes that the segment ids are in increasing order, using the last element of the tensor holding them to determine the dimensionality of output tensor. This results in allocating insufficient memory for the output tensor and in a write outside the bounds of the output array. This usually results in a segmentation fault, but depending on runtime conditions it can provide for a write gadget to be used in future memory corruption-based exploits. The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that the segment ids are sorted, although this only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model. A similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime between inference steps. If the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.
CVE-2020-15215||Electron before versions 11.0.0-beta.6, 10.1.2, 9.3.1 or 8.5.2 is vulnerable to a context isolation bypass. Apps using both `contextIsolation` and `sandbox: true` are affected. Apps using both `contextIsolation` and `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames: true` are affected. This is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.
CVE-2020-15216||In goxmldsig (XML Digital Signatures implemented in pure Go) before version 1.1.0, with a carefully crafted XML file, an attacker can completely bypass signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one. A patch is available, all users of goxmldsig should upgrade to at least revision f6188febf0c29d7ffe26a0436212b19cb9615e64 or version 1.1.0
CVE-2020-15217||In GLPI before version 9.5.2, there is a leakage of user information through the public FAQ. The issue was introduced in version 9.5.0 and patched in 9.5.2. As a workaround, disable public access to the FAQ.
CVE-2020-15218||Combodo iTop is a web based IT Service Management tool. In iTop before versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0, admin pages are cached, so that their content is visible after deconnection by using the browser back button. This is fixed in versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
CVE-2020-15219||Combodo iTop is a web based IT Service Management tool. In iTop before versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0, when a download error is triggered in the user portal, an SQL query is displayed to the user. This is fixed in versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
CVE-2020-1522||An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Speech Runtime improperly handles memory.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to gain execution on the victim system, aka 'Windows Speech Runtime Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-1521.
CVE-2020-15220||Combodo iTop is a web based IT Service Management tool. In iTop before versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0, two cookies are created for the same session, which leads to a possibility to steal user session. This is fixed in versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
CVE-2020-15221||Combodo iTop is a web based IT Service Management tool. In iTop before versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0, by modifying target browser local storage, an XSS can be generated in the iTop console breadcrumb. This is fixed in versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
CVE-2020-15222||In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go) before version 0.31.0, when using "private_key_jwt" authentication the uniqueness of the `jti` value is not checked. When using client authentication method "private_key_jwt", OpenId specification says the following about assertion `jti`: "A unique identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties". Hydra does not seem to check the uniqueness of this `jti` value. This problem is fixed in version 0.31.0.
CVE-2020-15223||In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go) before version 0.34.0, the `TokenRevocationHandler` ignores errors coming from the storage. This can lead to unexpected 200 status codes indicating successful revocation while the token is still valid. Whether an attacker can use this for her advantage depends on the ability to trigger errors in the store. This is fixed in version 0.34.0
CVE-2020-15224||In Open Enclave before version 0.12.0, an information disclosure vulnerability exists when an enclave application using the syscalls provided by the sockets.edl is loaded by a malicious host application. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could read privileged data from the enclave heap across trust boundaries. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information otherwise considered confidential in an enclave, which could be used in further compromises. The issue has been addressed in version 0.12.0 and the current master branch. Users will need to to recompile their applications against the patched libraries to be protected from this vulnerability.
CVE-2020-15225||django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based on user selections. In django-filter before version 2.4.0, automatically generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. Version 2.4.0+ applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter` implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade.
CVE-2020-15226||In GLPI before version 9.5.2, there is a SQL Injection in the API's search function. Not only is it possible to break the SQL syntax, but it is also possible to utilise a UNION SELECT query to reflect sensitive information such as the current database version, or database user. The most likely scenario for this vulnerability is with someone who has an API account to the system. The issue is patched in version 9.5.2. A proof-of-concept with technical details is available in the linked advisory.
CVE-2020-15227||Nette versions before 2.0.19, 2.1.13, 2.2.10, 2.3.14, 2.4.16, 3.0.6 are vulnerable to an code injection attack by passing specially formed parameters to URL that may possibly leading to RCE. Nette is a PHP/Composer MVC Framework.
CVE-2020-15228||In the `@actions/core` npm module before version 1.2.6,`addPath` and `exportVariable` functions communicate with the Actions Runner over stdout by generating a string in a specific format. Workflows that log untrusted data to stdout may invoke these commands, resulting in the path or environment variables being modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. The runner will release an update that disables the `set-env` and `add-path` workflow commands in the near future. For now, users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.2.6` or later, and replace any instance of the `set-env` or `add-path` commands in their workflows with the new Environment File Syntax. Workflows and actions using the old commands or older versions of the toolkit will start to warn, then error out during workflow execution.
CVE-2020-15229||Singularity (an open source container platform) from version 3.1.1 through 3.6.3 has a vulnerability. Due to insecure handling of path traversal and the lack of path sanitization within `unsquashfs`, it is possible to overwrite/create any files on the host filesystem during the extraction with a crafted squashfs filesystem. The extraction occurs automatically for unprivileged (either installation or with `allow setuid = no`) run of Singularity when a user attempt to run an image which is a local SIF image or a single file containing a squashfs filesystem and is coming from remote sources `library://` or `shub://`. Image build is also impacted in a more serious way as it can be used by a root user, allowing an attacker to overwrite/create files leading to a system compromise, so far bootstrap methods `library`, `shub` and `localimage` are triggering the squashfs extraction. This issue is addressed in Singularity 3.6.4. All users are advised to upgrade to 3.6.4 especially if they use Singularity mainly for building image as root user. There is no solid workaround except to temporary avoid to use unprivileged mode with single file images in favor of sandbox images instead. Regarding image build, temporary avoid to build from `library` and `shub` sources and as much as possible use `--fakeroot` or a VM for that.
CVE-2020-1523||A tampering vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server fails to properly handle profile data, aka 'Microsoft SharePoint Server Tampering Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-1440.
CVE-2020-15230||Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In Vapor before version 4.29.4, Attackers can access data at arbitrary filesystem paths on the same host as an application. Only applications using FileMiddleware are affected. This is fixed in version 4.29.4.
CVE-2020-15231||In mapfish-print before version 3.24, a user can use the JSONP support to do a Cross-site scripting.
CVE-2020-15232||In mapfish-print before version 3.24, a user can do to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack with the provided SDL style.
CVE-2020-15233||ORY Fosite is a security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go. In Fosite from version 0.30.2 and before version 0.34.1, there is an issue in which an an attacker can override the registered redirect URL by performing an OAuth flow and requesting a redirect URL that is to the loopback adapter. Attackers can provide both custom URL query parameters to their loopback redirect URL, as well as actually overriding the host of the registered redirect URL. These attacks are only applicable in scenarios where the attacker has access over the loopback interface. This vulnerability has been patched in ORY Fosite v0.34.1.
CVE-2020-15234||ORY Fosite is a security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go. In Fosite before version 0.34.1, the OAuth 2.0 Client's registered redirect URLs and the redirect URL provided at the OAuth2 Authorization Endpoint where compared using strings.ToLower while they should have been compared with a simple string match. This allows an attacker to register a client with allowed redirect URL https://example.com/callback. Then perform an OAuth2 flow and requesting redirect URL https://example.com/CALLBACK. Instead of an error (invalid redirect URL), the browser is redirected to https://example.com/CALLBACK with a potentially successful OAuth2 response, depending on the state of the overall OAuth2 flow (the user might still deny the request for example). This vulnerability has been patched in ORY Fosite v0.34.1.
CVE-2020-15235||In RACTF before commit f3dc89b, unauthenticated users are able to get the value of sensitive config keys that would normally be hidden to everyone except admins. All versions after commit f3dc89b9f6ab1544a289b3efc06699b13d63e0bd(3/10/20) are patched.
CVE-2020-15236||In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit 084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`) sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities such as Local File System and Git.
CVE-2020-15237||In Shrine before version 3.3.0, when using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin, it's possible for the attacker to use a timing attack to guess the signature of the derivation URL. The problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated signature in constant time, using `Rack::Utils.secure_compare`. Users using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin are urged to upgrade to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater. A possible workaround is provided in the linked advisory.
CVE-2020-15238||Blueman is a GTK+ Bluetooth Manager. In Blueman before 2.1.4, the DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to an argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled for version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheel group in the shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to `ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and without ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in 2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZ network object paths instead of network interface names. A backport to 2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make sure that Polkit-1-support is enabled and limit privileges for the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action to users that are able to run arbitrary commands as root anyway in /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.
CVE-2020-15239||In xmpp-http-upload before version 0.4.0, when the GET method is attacked, attackers can read files which have a `.data` suffix and which are accompanied by a JSON file with the `.meta` suffix. This can lead to Information Disclosure and in some shared-hosting scenarios also to circumvention of authentication or other limitations on the outbound (GET) traffic. For example, in a scenario where a single server has multiple instances of the application running (with separate DATA_ROOT settings), an attacker who has knowledge about the directory structure is able to read files from any other instance to which the process has read access. If instances have individual authentication (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy, source IP based filtering) or other restrictions (such as quotas), attackers may circumvent those limits in such a scenario by using the Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other instances. If the associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is malicious, they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which are written are constrained to have the `.meta` and the `.data` suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the JSON with the Content-Type of the original request and the `.data` file will contain the payload. The issue is patched in version 0.4.0.
CVE-2020-1524||An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Speech Shell Components improperly handle memory.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to gain execution on the victim system, aka 'Windows Speech Shell Components Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.
CVE-2020-15240||omniauth-auth0 (rubygems) versions >= 2.3.0 and < 2.4.1 improperly validate the JWT token signature when using the `jwt_validator.verify` method. Improper validation of the JWT token signature can allow an attacker to bypass authentication and authorization. You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply: 1. You are using `omniauth-auth0`. 2. You are using `JWTValidator.verify` method directly OR you are not authenticating using the SDK’s default Authorization Code Flow. The issue is patched in version 2.4.1.
CVE-2020-15241||TYPO3 Fluid Engine (package `typo3fluid/fluid`) before versions 2.0.5, 2.1.4, 2.2.1, 2.3.5, 2.4.1, 2.5.5 or 2.6.1 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when making use of the ternary conditional operator in templates like `{showFullName ? fullName : defaultValue}`. Updated versions of this package are bundled in following TYPO3 (`typo3/cms-core`) versions as well: TYPO3 v8.7.25 (using `typo3fluid/fluid` v2.5.4) and TYPO3 v9.5.6 (using `typo3fluid/fluid` v2.6.1).
CVE-2020-15242||Next.js versions >=9.5.0 and <9.5.4 are vulnerable to an Open Redirect. Specially encoded paths could be used with the trailing slash redirect to allow an open redirect to occur to an external site. In general, this redirect does not directly harm users although can allow for phishing attacks by redirecting to an attackers domain from a trusted domain. The issue is fixed in version 9.5.4.
CVE-2020-15243||Affected versions of Smartstore have a missing WebApi Authentication attribute. This vulnerability affects Smartstore shops in version 4.0.0 & 4.0.1 which have installed and activated the Web API plugin. Users of Smartstore 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 must merge their repository with 4.0.x or overwrite the file SmartStore.Web.Framework in the */bin* directory of the deployed shop with this file. As a workaround without updating uninstall the Web API plugin to close this vulnerability.
CVE-2020-15244||In Magento (rubygems openmage/magento-lts package) before versions 19.4.8 and 20.0.4, an admin user can generate soap credentials that can be used to trigger RCE via PHP Object Injection through product attributes and a product. The issue is patched in versions 19.4.8 and 20.0.4.
CVE-2020-15245||In Sylius before versions 1.6.9, 1.7.9 and 1.8.3, the user may register in a shop by email mail@example.com, verify it, change it to the mail another@domain.com and stay verified and enabled. This may lead to having accounts addressed to totally different emails, that were verified. Note, that this way one is not able to take over any existing account (guest or normal one). The issue has been patched in Sylius 1.6.9, 1.7.9 and 1.8.3. As a workaround, you may resolve this issue on your own by creating a custom event listener, which will listen to the sylius.customer.pre_update event. You can determine that email has been changed if customer email and user username are different. They are synchronized later on. Pay attention, to email changing behavior for administrators. You may need to skip this logic for them. In order to achieve this, you should either check master request path info, if it does not contain /admin prefix or adjust event triggered during customer update in the shop. You can find more information on how to customize the event here.
CVE-2020-15246||October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.421 and before version 1.0.469, an attacker can read local files on an October CMS server via a specially crafted request. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.
CVE-2020-15247||October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.469, an authenticated backend user with the cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.
CVE-2020-15248||October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.470, backend users with the default "Publisher" system role have access to create & manage users where they can choose which role the new user has. This means that a user with "Publisher" access has the ability to escalate their access to "Developer" access. Issue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) & v1.1.1.
CVE-2020-15249||October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.469, backend users with access to upload files were permitted to upload SVG files without any sanitization applied to the uploaded files. Since SVG files support being parsed as HTML by browsers, this means that they could theoretically upload Javascript that would be executed on a path under the website's domain (i.e. /storage/app/media/evil.svg), but they would have to convince their target to visit that location directly in the target's browser as the backend does not display SVGs inline anywhere, SVGs are only displayed as image resources in the backend and are thus unable to be executed. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) & v1.1.0.
CVE-2020-1525||A memory corruption vulnerability exists when Windows Media Foundation improperly handles objects in memory, aka 'Media Foundation Memory Corruption Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-1379, CVE-2020-1477, CVE-2020-1478, CVE-2020-1492, CVE-2020-1554.
CVE-2020-15250||In JUnit4 from version 4.7 and before 4.13.1, the test rule TemporaryFolder contains a local information disclosure vulnerability. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder, and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you must use the workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability. For more information, including an example of vulnerable code, see the referenced GitHub Security Advisory.
CVE-2020-15251||In the Channelmgnt plug-in for Sopel (a Python IRC bot) before version 1.0.3, malicious users are able to op/voice and take over a channel. This is an ACL bypass vulnerability. This plugin is bundled with MirahezeBot-Plugins with versions from 9.0.0 and less than 9.0.2 affected. Version 9.0.2 includes 1.0.3 of channelmgnt, and thus is safe from this vulnerability. See referenced GHSA-23pc-4339-95vg.
CVE-2020-15252||In XWiki before version 12.5 and 11.10.6, any user with SCRIPT right (EDIT right before XWiki 7.4) can gain access to the application server Servlet context which contains tools allowing to instantiate arbitrary Java objects and invoke methods that may lead to arbitrary code execution. This is patched in XWiki 12.5 and XWiki 11.10.6.
CVE-2020-15253||Versions of Grocy <= 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via the Create Shopping List module, that is rendered upon deleting that Shopping List. The issue was also found in users, batteries, chores, equipment, locations, quantity units, shopping locations, tasks, taskcategories, product groups, recipes and products. Authentication is required to exploit these issues and Grocy should not be publicly exposed. The linked reference details a proof-of-concept.
CVE-2020-15254||Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.
CVE-2020-15255||In Anuko Time Tracker before verion 1.19.23.5325, due to not properly filtered user input a CSV export of a report could contain cells that are treated as formulas by spreadsheet software (for example, when a cell value starts with an equal sign). This is fixed in version 1.19.23.5325.
CVE-2020-15256||A prototype pollution vulnerability has been found in `object-path` <= 0.11.4 affecting the `set()` method. The vulnerability is limited to the `includeInheritedProps` mode (if version >= 0.11.0 is used), which has to be explicitly enabled by creating a new instance of `object-path` and setting the option `includeInheritedProps: true`, or by using the default `withInheritedProps` instance. The default operating mode is not affected by the vulnerability if version >= 0.11.0 is used. Any usage of `set()` in versions < 0.11.0 is vulnerable. The issue is fixed in object-path version 0.11.5 As a workaround, don't use the `includeInheritedProps: true` options or the `withInheritedProps` instance if using a version >= 0.11.0.
CVE-2020-15257||containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim’s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the "host" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.
CVE-2020-15258||In Wire before 3.20.x, `shell.openExternal` was used without checking the URL. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code on the victims machine by sending messages containing links with arbitrary protocols. The victim has to interact with the link and sees the URL that is opened. The issue was patched by implementing a helper function which checks if the URL's protocol is common. If it is common, the URL will be opened externally. If not, the URL will not be opened and a warning appears for the user informing them that a probably insecure URL was blocked from being executed. The issue is patched in Wire 3.20.x. More technical details about exploitation are available in the linked advisory.
CVE-2020-15259||ad-ldap-connector's admin panel before version 5.0.13 does not provide csrf protection, which when exploited may result in remote code execution or confidential data loss. CSRF exploits may occur if the user visits a malicious page containing CSRF payload on the same machine that has access to the ad-ldap-connector admin console via a browser. You may be affected if you use the admin console included with ad-ldap-connector versions <=5.0.12.

CVE-2020-1526||An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Network Connection Broker improperly handles memory.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to gain execution on the victim system, aka 'Windows Network Connection Broker Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.
CVE-2020-15260||PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In version 2.10 and earlier, PJSIP transport can be reused if they have the same IP address + port + protocol. However, this is insufficient for secure transport since it lacks remote hostname authentication. Suppose we have created a TLS connection to `sip.foo.com`, which has an IP address `100.1.1.1`. If we want to create a TLS connection to another hostname, say `sip.bar.com`, which has the same IP address, then it will reuse that existing connection, even though `100.1.1.1` does not have certificate to authenticate as `sip.bar.com`. The vulnerability allows for an insecure interaction without user awareness. It affects users who need access to connections to different destinations that translate to the same address, and allows man-in-the-middle attack if attacker can route a connection to another destination such as in the case of DNS spoofing.
CVE-2020-15261||On Windows the Veyon Service before version 4.4.2 contains an unquoted service path vulnerability, allowing locally authenticated users with administrative privileges to run malicious executables with LocalSystem privileges. Since Veyon users (both students and teachers) usually don't have administrative privileges, this vulnerability is only dangerous in anyway unsafe setups. The problem has been fixed in version 4.4.2. As a workaround, the exploitation of the vulnerability can be prevented by revoking administrative privileges from all potentially untrustworthy users.
CVE-2020-15262||In webpack-subresource-integrity before version 1.5.1, all dynamically loaded chunks receive an invalid integrity hash that is ignored by the browser, and therefore the browser cannot validate their integrity. This removes the additional level of protection offered by SRI for such chunks. Top-level chunks are unaffected. This issue is patched in version 1.5.1.
CVE-2020-15263||In platform before version 9.4.4, inline attributes are not properly escaped. If the data that came from users was not escaped, then an XSS vulnerability is possible. The issue was introduced in 9.0.0 and fixed in 9.4.4.
CVE-2020-15264||The Boxstarter installer before version 2.13.0 configures C:\ProgramData\Boxstarter to be in the system-wide PATH environment variable. However, this directory is writable by normal, unprivileged users. To exploit the vulnerability, place a DLL in this directory that a privileged service is looking for. For example, WptsExtensions.dll When Windows starts, it'll execute the code in DllMain() with SYSTEM privileges. Any unprivileged user can execute code with SYSTEM privileges. The issue is fixed in version 3.13.0
CVE-2020-15265||In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, an attacker can pass an invalid `axis` value to `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`. This results in accessing a dimension outside the rank of the input tensor in the C++ kernel implementation. However, dim_size only does a DCHECK to validate the argument and then uses it to access the corresponding element of an array. Since in normal builds, `DCHECK`-like macros are no-ops, this results in segfault and access out of bounds of the array. The issue is patched in eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808 and TensorFlow 2.4.0 will be released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.
CVE-2020-15266||In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, when the `boxes` argument of `tf.image.crop_and_resize` has a very large value, the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ `nan` floating point value. Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later produces a segmentation fault. The issue is patched in eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808 and TensorFlow 2.4.0 will be released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.
CVE-2020-15269||In Spree before versions 3.7.11, 4.0.4, or 4.1.11, expired user tokens could be used to access Storefront API v2 endpoints. The issue is patched in versions 3.7.11, 4.0.4 and 4.1.11. A workaround without upgrading is described in the linked advisory.
CVE-2020-1527||An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Custom Protocol Engine improperly handles memory.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to gain execution on the victim system, aka 'Windows Custom Protocol Engine Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.
CVE-2020-15270||Parse Server (npm package parse-server) broadcasts events to all clients without checking if the session token is valid. This allows clients with expired sessions to still receive subscription objects. It is not possible to create subscription objects with invalid session tokens. The issue is not patched.
CVE-2020-15271||In lookatme (python/pypi package) versions prior to 2.3.0, the package automatically loaded the built-in "terminal" and "file_loader" extensions. Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.
CVE-2020-15272||In the git-tag-annotation-action (open source GitHub Action) before version 1.0.1, an attacker can execute arbitrary (*) shell commands if they can control the value of [the `tag` input] or manage to alter the value of [the `GITHUB_REF` environment variable]. The problem has been patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't use the `tag` input you are most likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is protected by the GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be impossible. If you must use the `tag` input and cannot upgrade to `> 1.0.0` make sure that the value is not controlled by another Action.
CVE-2020-15273||baserCMS before version 4.4.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The issue affects the following components: Edit feed settings, Edit widget area, Sub site new registration, New category registration. Arbitrary JavaScript may be executed by entering specific characters in the account that can access the file upload function category list, subsite setting list, widget area edit, and feed list on the management screen. The issue was introduced in version 4.0.0. It is fixed in version 4.4.1.
CVE-2020-15274||In Wiki.js before version 2.5.162, an XSS payload can be injected in a page title and executed via the search results. While the title is properly escaped in both the navigation links and the actual page title, it is not the case in the search results. Commit a57d9af34c15adbf460dde6553d964efddf433de fixes this vulnerability (version 2.5.162) by properly escaping the text content displayed in the search results.
CVE-2020-15275||MoinMoin is a wiki engine. In MoinMoin before version 1.9.11, an attacker with write permissions can upload an SVG file that contains malicious javascript. This javascript will be executed in a user's browser when the user is viewing that SVG file on the wiki. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version. MoinMoin Wiki 1.9.11 has the necessary fixes and also contains other important fixes.
CVE-2020-15276||baserCMS before version 4.4.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Arbitrary JavaScript may be executed by entering a crafted nickname in blog comments. The issue affects the blog comment component. It is fixed in version 4.4.1.
CVE-2020-15277||baserCMS before version 4.4.1 is affected by Remote Code Execution (RCE). Code may be executed by logging in as a system administrator and uploading an executable script file such as a PHP file. The Edit template component is vulnerable. The issue is fixed in version 4.4.1.
CVE-2020-15278||Red Discord Bot before version 3.4.1 has an unauthorized privilege escalation exploit in the Mod module. This exploit allows Discord users with a high privilege level within the guild to bypass hierarchy checks when the application is in a specific condition that is beyond that user's control. By abusing this exploit, it is possible to perform destructive actions within the guild the user has high privileges in. This exploit has been fixed in version 3.4.1. As a workaround, unloading the Mod module with unload mod or, disabling the massban command with command disable global massban can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to 3.4.1 to completely patch this issue.

CVE-2020-15563||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 HVM guest OS users to cause a hypervisor crash. An inverted conditional in x86 HVM guests' dirty video RAM tracking code allows such guests to make Xen de-reference a pointer guaranteed to point at unmapped space. A malicious or buggy HVM guest may cause the hypervisor to crash, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Xen versions from 4.8 onwards are affected. Xen versions 4.7 and earlier are not affected. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using shadow paging can leverage the vulnerability. In addition, there needs to be an entity actively monitoring a guest's video frame buffer (typically for display purposes) in order for such a guest to be able to leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV guests, as well as x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP), cannot leverage the vulnerability.
CVE-2020-15564||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Arm guest OS users to cause a hypervisor crash because of a missing alignment check in VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info. The hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info is used by a guest to register a shared region with the hypervisor. The region will be mapped into Xen address space so it can be directly accessed. On Arm, the region is accessed with instructions that require a specific alignment. Unfortunately, there is no check that the address provided by the guest will be correctly aligned. As a result, a malicious guest could cause a hypervisor crash by passing a misaligned address. A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). All Xen versions are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.
CVE-2020-15565||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of insufficient cache write-back under VT-d. When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to them require flushing of both TLBs. Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent, and hence prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs, a CPU cache also needs writing back to memory after changes were made. Such writing back of cached data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings into smaller granularity ones. A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later reused for another purpose. Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege escalation cannot be ruled out. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only x86 Intel systems are affected. x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP), having a passed through PCI device assigned, and having page table sharing enabled can leverage the vulnerability. Note that page table sharing will be enabled (by default) only if Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page size support compatible.
CVE-2020-15566||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a host OS crash because of incorrect error handling in event-channel port allocation. The allocation of an event-channel port may fail for multiple reasons: (1) port is already in use, (2) the memory allocation failed, or (3) the port we try to allocate is higher than what is supported by the ABI (e.g., 2L or FIFO) used by the guest or the limit set by an administrator (max_event_channels in xl cfg). Due to the missing error checks, only (1) will be considered an error. All the other cases will provide a valid port and will result in a crash when trying to access the event channel. When the administrator configured a guest to allow more than 1023 event channels, that guest may be able to crash the host. When Xen is out-of-memory, allocation of new event channels will result in crashing the host rather than reporting an error. Xen versions 4.10 and later are affected. All architectures are affected. The default configuration, when guests are created with xl/libxl, is not vulnerable, because of the default event-channel limit.
CVE-2020-15567||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Intel guest OS users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service because of non-atomic modification of a live EPT PTE. When mapping guest EPT (nested paging) tables, Xen would in some circumstances use a series of non-atomic bitfield writes. Depending on the compiler version and optimisation flags, Xen might expose a dangerous partially written PTE to the hardware, which an attacker might be able to race to exploit. A guest administrator or perhaps even an unprivileged guest user might be able to cause denial of service, data corruption, or privilege escalation. Only systems using Intel CPUs are vulnerable. Systems using AMD CPUs, and Arm systems, are not vulnerable. Only systems using nested paging (hap, aka nested paging, aka in this case Intel EPT) are vulnerable. Only HVM and PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability. The presence and scope of the vulnerability depends on the precise optimisations performed by the compiler used to build Xen. If the compiler generates (a) a single 64-bit write, or (b) a series of read-modify-write operations in the same order as the source code, the hypervisor is not vulnerable. For example, in one test build using GCC 8.3 with normal settings, the compiler generated multiple (unlocked) read-modify-write operations in source-code order, which did not constitute a vulnerability. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code-generation options). The source code clearly violates the C rules, and thus should be considered vulnerable.
CVE-2020-15568||TerraMaster TOS before 4.1.29 has Invalid Parameter Checking that leads to code injection as root.

CVE-2020-15590||A vulnerability in the Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client for Linux 1.5 through 2.3+ allows remote attackers to bypass an intended VPN kill switch mechanism and read sensitive information via intercepting network traffic. Since 1.5, PIA has supported a “split tunnel” OpenVPN bypass option. The PIA killswitch & associated iptables firewall is designed to protect you while using the Internet. When the kill switch is configured to block all inbound and outbound network traffic, privileged applications can continue sending & receiving network traffic if net.ipv4.ip_forward has been enabled in the system kernel parameters. For example, a Docker container running on a host with the VPN turned off, and the kill switch turned on, can continue using the internet, leaking the host IP (CWE 200). In PIA 2.4.0+, policy-based routing is enabled by default and is used to direct all forwarded packets to the VPN interface automatically.

CVE-2020-15592||SteelCentral Aternity Agent before 11.0.0.120 on Windows allows Privilege Escalation via a crafted file. It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. The remotely callable methods from remotable objects available through interprocess communication allow loading of arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the "%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins” directory, where the name of the plugin is passed as part of an XML-serialized object. However, because the name of the DLL is concatenated with the “.\plugins” string, a directory traversal vulnerability exists in the way plugins are resolved.
CVE-2020-15593||SteelCentral Aternity Agent 11.0.0.120 on Windows mishandles IPC. It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. Any user in the system is allowed to access the interprocess communication channel AternityAgentAssistantIpc, retrieve a serialized object and call object methods remotely. Among others, the methods allow any user to: (1) Create and/or overwrite arbitrary XML files across the system; (2) Create arbitrary directories across the system; and (3) Load arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the "%PROGRAMFILES(X86)/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins” directory and execute code contained in them.

CVE-2020-15598||** DISPUTED ** Trustwave ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.4 allows denial of service via a special request. NOTE: The discoverer reports "Trustwave has signaled they are disputing our claims." The CVE suggests that there is a security issue with how ModSecurity handles regular expressions that can result in a Denial of Service condition. The vendor does not consider this as a security issue because1) there is no default configuration issue here. An attacker would need to know that a rule using a potentially problematic regular expression was in place, 2) the attacker would need to know the basic nature of the regular expression itself to exploit any resource issues. It's well known that regular expression usage can be taxing on system resources regardless of the use case. It is up to the administrator to decide on when it is appropriate to trade resources for potential security benefit.

CVE-2020-15810||An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Smuggling attacks may succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison the proxy cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary source. When configured for relaxed header parsing (the default), Squid relays headers containing whitespace characters to upstream servers. When this occurs as a prefix to a Content-Length header, the frame length specified will be ignored by Squid (allowing for a conflicting length to be used from another Content-Length header) but relayed upstream.
CVE-2020-15811||An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Splitting attacks may succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local security and poison the browser cache and any downstream caches with content from an arbitrary source. Squid uses a string search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header to find chunked encoding. This allows an attacker to hide a second request inside Transfer-Encoding: it is interpreted by Squid as chunked and split out into a second request delivered upstream. Squid will then deliver two distinct responses to the client, corrupting any downstream caches.
CVE-2020-15813||Graylog before 3.3.3 lacks SSL Certificate Validation for LDAP servers. It allows use of an external user/group database stored in LDAP. The connection configuration allows the usage of unencrypted, SSL- or TLS-secured connections. Unfortunately, the Graylog client code (in all versions that support LDAP) does not implement proper certificate validation (regardless of whether the "Allow self-signed certificates" option is used). Therefore, any attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic between a Graylog server and an LDAP server is able to redirect traffic to a different LDAP server (unnoticed by the Graylog server due to the lack of certificate validation), effectively bypassing Graylog's authentication mechanism.
CVE-2020-15816||In Western Digital WD Discovery before 4.0.251.0, a malicious application running with standard user permissions could potentially execute code in the application's process through library injection by using DYLD environment variables.

CVE-2020-15892||An issue was discovered in apply.cgi on D-Link DAP-1520 devices before 1.10b04Beta02. Whenever a user performs a login action from the web interface, the request values are being forwarded to the ssi binary. On the login page, the web interface restricts the password input field to a fixed length of 15 characters. The problem is that validation is being done on the client side, hence it can be bypassed. When an attacker manages to intercept the login request (POST based) and tampers with the vulnerable parameter (log_pass), to a larger length, the request will be forwarded to the webserver. This results in a stack-based buffer overflow. A few other POST variables, (transferred as part of the login request) are also vulnerable: html_response_page and log_user.
CVE-2020-15893||An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-816L devices 2.x before 1.10b04Beta02. Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is enabled by default on port 1900. An attacker can perform command injection by injecting a payload into the Search Target (ST) field of the SSDP M-SEARCH discover packet.

CVE-2020-15909||SolarWinds N-central through 2020.1 allows session hijacking and requires user interaction or physical access. The N-Central JSESSIONID cookie attribute is not checked against multiple sources such as sourceip, MFA claim, etc. as long as the victim stays logged in within N-Central. To take advantage of this, cookie could be stolen and the JSESSIONID can be captured. On its own this is not a surprising result; low security tools allow the cookie to roam from machine to machine. The JSESSION cookie can then be used on the attackers’ workstation by browsing to the victim’s NCentral server URL and replacing the JSESSIONID attribute value by the captured value. Expected behavior would be to check this against a second source and enforce at least a reauthentication or multi factor request as N-Central is a highly privileged service.

CVE-2020-1603||Specific IPv6 packets sent by clients processed by the Routing Engine (RE) are improperly handled. These IPv6 packets are designed to be blocked by the RE from egressing the RE. Instead, the RE allows these specific IPv6 packets to egress the RE, at which point a mbuf memory leak occurs within the Juniper Networks Junos OS device. This memory leak eventually leads to a kernel crash (vmcore), or the device hanging and requiring a power cycle to restore service, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. During the time where mbufs are rising, yet not fully filled, some traffic from client devices may begin to be black holed. To be black holed, this traffic must match the condition where this traffic must be processed by the RE. Continued receipt and attempted egress of these specific IPv6 packets from the Routing Engine (RE) will create an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Scenarios which have been observed are: 1. In a single chassis, single RE scenario, the device will hang without vmcore, or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario the device needs to be power cycled. 2. In a single chassis, dual RE scenario, the device master RE will fail over to the backup RE. In this scenario, the master and the backup REs need to be reset from time to time when they vmcore. There is no need to power cycle the device. 3. In a dual chassis, single RE scenario, the device will hang without vmcore, or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario, the two chassis' design relies upon some type of network level redundancy - VRRP, GRES, NSR, etc. - 3.a In a commanded switchover, where nonstop active routing (NSR) is enabled no session loss is observed. 4. In a dual chassis, dual chassis scenario, rely upon the RE to RE failover as stated in the second scenario. In the unlikely event that the device does not switch RE to RE gracefully, then the fallback position is to the network level services scenario in the third scenario. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S6; 16.1 version 16.1X70-D10 and later; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S11; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S11, 17.1R3-S1; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S9, 17.2R2-S8, 17.2R3-S3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S6; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S9, 17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S7; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S2; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D50, 18.2X75-D410; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S6, 18.3R2-S2, 18.3R3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S6, 18.4R2-S2, 18.4R3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S3, 19.1R2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S2, 19.2R2.

Fixed in Ubuntu Linux kernel 5.4.0-51.56, 5.3.0-68.63, 4.15.0-121.123, 4.4.0-193.224, 3.13.0.182.191 and 3.2.0-149.196.
CVE-2020-16120||Overlayfs did not properly perform permission checking when copying up files in an overlayfs and could be exploited from within a user namespace, if, for example, unprivileged user namespaces were allowed. It was possible to have a file not readable by an unprivileged user to be copied to a mountpoint controlled by the user, like a removable device. This was introduced in kernel version 4.19 by commit d1d04ef ("ovl: stack file ops"). This was fixed in kernel version 5.8 by commits 56230d9 ("ovl: verify permissions in ovl_path_open()"), 48bd024 ("ovl: switch to mounter creds in readdir") and 05acefb ("ovl: check permission to open real file"). Additionally, commits 130fdbc ("ovl: pass correct flags for opening real directory") and 292f902 ("ovl: call secutiry hook in ovl_real_ioctl()") in kernel 5.8 might also be desired or necessary. These additional commits introduced a regression in overlay mounts within user namespaces which prevented access to files with ownership outside of the user namespace. This regression was mitigated by subsequent commit b6650da ("ovl: do not fail because of O_NOATIMEi") in kernel 5.11.

CVE-2020-1617||This issue occurs on Juniper Networks Junos OS devices which do not support Advanced Forwarding Interface (AFI) / Advanced Forwarding Toolkit (AFT). Devices using AFI and AFT are not exploitable to this issue. An improper initialization of memory in the packet forwarding architecture in Juniper Networks Junos OS non-AFI/AFT platforms which may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability being exploited when a genuine packet is received and inspected by non-AFT/AFI sFlow and when the device is also configured with firewall policers. This first genuine packet received and inspected by sampled flow (sFlow) through a specific firewall policer will cause the device to reboot. After the reboot has completed, if the device receives and sFlow inspects another genuine packet seen through a specific firewall policer, the device will generate a core file and reboot. Continued inspection of these genuine packets will create an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Depending on the method for service restoration, e.g. hard boot or soft reboot, a core file may or may not be generated the next time the packet is received and inspected by sFlow. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S9, 17.4R3 on PTX1000 and PTX10000 Series, QFX10000 Series; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S9 on PTX1000 and PTX10000 Series, QFX10000 Series; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D12, 18.2X75-D30 on PTX1000 and PTX10000 Series, QFX10000 Series; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3 on PTX1000 and PTX10000 Series, QFX10000 Series; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3 on PTX1000 and PTX10000 Series, QFX10000 Series. This issue is not applicable to Junos OS versions before 17.4R1. This issue is not applicable to Junos OS Evolved or Junos OS with Advanced Forwarding Toolkit (AFT) forwarding implementations which use a different implementation of sFlow. The following example information is unrelated to this issue and is provided solely to assist you with determining if you have AFT or not. Example: A Junos OS device which supports the use of EVPN signaled VPWS with Flexible Cross Connect uses the AFT implementation. Since this configuration requires support and use of the AFT implementation to support this configuration, the device is not vulnerable to this issue as the sFlow implementation is different using the AFT architecture. For further details about AFT visit the AFI / AFT are in the links below. If you are uncertain if you use the AFI/AFT implementation or not, there are configuration examples in the links below which you may use to determine if you are vulnerable to this issue or not. If the commands work, you are. If not, you are not. You may also use the Feature Explorer to determine if AFI/AFT is supported or not. If you are still uncertain, please contact your support resources.

(CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns "=*;*&" or "*%3b*&" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match "=*;*&|=*%3b*&" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match "=*;*&|=*%3b*&" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match "=*;*&|=*%3b*&" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked.

CVE-2020-1673||Insufficient Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection in Juniper Networks J-Web and web based (HTTP/HTTPS) services allows an unauthenticated attacker to hijack the target user's HTTP/HTTPS session and perform administrative actions on the Junos device as the targeted user. This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled such as J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to convince the device administrator to take action such as clicking the crafted URL sent via phishing email or convince the administrator to input data in the browser console. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S1; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S2; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S1; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S4, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2.

CVE-2020-1679||On Juniper Networks PTX and QFX Series devices with packet sampling configured using tunnel-observation mpls-over-udp, sampling of a malformed packet can cause the Kernel Routing Table (KRT) queue to become stuck. KRT is the module within the Routing Process Daemon (RPD) that synchronized the routing tables with the forwarding tables in the kernel. This table is then synchronized to the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) via the KRT queue. Thus, when KRT queue become stuck, it can lead to unexpected packet forwarding issues. An administrator can monitor the following command to check if there is the KRT queue is stuck: user@device > show krt state ... Number of async queue entries: 65007 <--- this value keep on increasing. When this issue occurs, the following message might appear in the /var/log/messages: DATE DEVICE kernel: %KERN-3: rt_pfe_veto: Too many delayed route/nexthop unrefs.

CVE-2020-1681||Receipt of a specifically malformed NDP packet sent from the local area network (LAN) to a device running Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved can cause the ndp process to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). The process automatically restarts without intervention, but a continuous receipt of the malformed NDP packets could leaded to an extended Denial of Service condition. During this time, IPv6 neighbor learning will be affected. The issue occurs when parsing the incoming malformed NDP packet. Rather than simply discarding the packet, the process asserts, performing a controlled exit and restart, thereby avoiding any chance of an unhandled exception. Exploitation of this vulnerability is limited to a temporary denial of service, and cannot be leveraged to cause additional impact on the system. This issue is limited to the processing of IPv6 NDP packets. IPv4 packet processing cannot trigger, and is unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue affects all Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.1R2-EVO. Junos OS is unaffected by this vulnerability.

CVE-2020-1685||When configuring stateless firewall filters in Juniper Networks EX4600 and QFX 5000 Series devices using Virtual Extensible LAN protocol (VXLAN), the discard action will fail to discard traffic under certain conditions. Given a firewall filter configuration similar to: family ethernet-switching { filter L2-VLAN { term ALLOW { from { user-vlan-id 100; } then { accept; } } term NON-MATCH { then { discard; } } when there is only one term containing a 'user-vlan-id' match condition, and no other terms in the firewall filter except discard, the discard action for non-matching traffic will only discard traffic with the same VLAN ID specified under 'user-vlan-id'. Other traffic (e.g. VLAN ID 200) will not be discarded. This unexpected behavior can lead to unintended traffic passing through the interface where the firewall filter is applied. This issue only affects systems using VXLANs. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5K Series: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S7, except 18.1R3; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S1; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S5, 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R2-S1, 18.4R3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2.

CVE-2020-17029||Windows Canonical Display Driver Information Disclosure Vulnerability
CVE-2020-1703||** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: Red Hat Product Security does not consider this as a security flaw. Password changes aren't expected to invalidate existing sessions. Though this is how Kerberos behaves: incrementing kvno will not invalidate any existing service tickets. This is not a concern because the lifetime on service tickets should be set appropriately (initially only a global, now also more finely configurable with the kdcpolicy plugin). This belief is reinforced by our use of mod_session: existing sessions there aren't terminated, but instead wait for expiration.
