CVE-2017-2290||On Windows installations of the mcollective-puppet-agent plugin, version 1.12.0, a non-administrator user can create an executable that will be executed with administrator privileges on the next "mco puppet" run. Puppet Enterprise users are not affected. This is resolved in mcollective-puppet-agent 1.12.1.
CVE-2017-2292||Versions of MCollective prior to 2.10.4 deserialized YAML from agents without calling safe_load, allowing the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server. The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on this insecure behavior.
CVE-2017-2293||Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 shipped with an MCollective configuration that allowed the package plugin to install or remove arbitrary packages on all managed agents. This release adds default configuration to not allow these actions. Customers who rely on this functionality can change this policy.
CVE-2017-2294||Versions of Puppet Enterprise prior to 2016.4.5 or 2017.2.1 failed to mark MCollective server private keys as sensitive (a feature added in Puppet 4.6), so key values could be logged and stored in PuppetDB. These releases use the sensitive data type to ensure this won't happen anymore.
CVE-2017-2295||Versions of Puppet prior to 4.10.1 will deserialize data off the wire (from the agent to the server, in this case) with a attacker-specified format. This could be used to force YAML deserialization in an unsafe manner, which would lead to remote code execution. This change constrains the format of data on the wire to PSON or safely decoded YAML.
CVE-2017-2296||In Puppet Enterprise 2017.1.x and 2017.2.1, using specially formatted strings with certain formatting characters as Classifier node group names or RBAC role display names causes errors, effectively causing a DOS to the service. This was resolved in Puppet Enterprise 2017.2.2.
CVE-2017-2297||Puppet Enterprise versions prior to 2016.4.5 and 2017.2.1 did not correctly authenticate users before returning labeled RBAC access tokens. This issue has been fixed in Puppet Enterprise 2016.4.5 and 2017.2.1. This only affects users with labeled tokens, which is not the default for tokens.
CVE-2017-2298||The mcollective-sshkey-security plugin before 0.5.1 for Puppet uses a server-specified identifier as part of a path where a file is written. A compromised server could use this to write a file to an arbitrary location on the client with the filename appended with the string "_pub.pem".
CVE-2017-2299||Versions of the puppetlabs-apache module prior to 1.11.1 and 2.1.0 make it very easy to accidentally misconfigure TLS trust. If you specify the `ssl_ca` parameter but do not specify the `ssl_certs_dir` parameter, a default will be provided for the `ssl_certs_dir` that will trust certificates from any of the system-trusted certificate authorities. This did not affect FreeBSD.
CVE-2017-2300||On Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateways chassis clusters running Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D65, 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D40, 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D60, flowd daemon on the primary node of an SRX Series chassis cluster may crash and restart when attempting to synchronize a multicast session created via crafted multicast packets.

CVE-2017-2308||An XML External Entity Injection vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos Space versions prior to 16.1R1 may allow an authenticated user to read arbitrary files on the device.
CVE-2017-2309||On Juniper Networks Junos Space versions prior to 16.1R1 when certificate based authentication is enabled for the Junos Space cluster, some restricted web services are accessible over the network. This represents an information leak risk.
CVE-2017-2310||A firewall bypass vulnerability in the host based firewall of Juniper Networks Junos Space versions prior to 16.1R1 may permit certain crafted packets, representing a network integrity risk.
CVE-2017-2311||On Juniper Networks Junos Space versions prior to 16.1R1, an unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to Junos space device can easily create a denial of service condition.
CVE-2017-2312||On Juniper Networks devices running Junos OS affected versions and with LDP enabled, a specific LDP packet destined to the RE (Routing Engine) will consume a small amount of the memory allocated for the rpd (routing protocol daemon) process. Over time, repeatedly receiving this type of LDP packet(s) will cause the memory to exhaust and the rpd process to crash and restart. It is not possible to free up the memory that has been consumed without restarting the rpd process. This issue affects Junos OS based devices with either IPv4 or IPv6 LDP enabled via the [protocols ldp] configuration (the native IPv6 support for LDP is available in Junos OS 16.1 and higher). The interface on which the packet arrives needs to have LDP enabled. The affected Junos versions are: 13.3 prior to 13.3R10; 14.1 prior to 14.1R8; 14.2 prior to 14.2R7-S6 or 14.2R8; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S14, 15.1F6-S4, 15.1F7, 15.1R4-S7, 15.1R5; 15.1X49 before 15.1X49-D70; 15.1X53 before 15.1X53-D230, 15.1X53-D63, 15.1X53-D70; 16.1 before 16.1R2. 16.2R1 and all subsequent releases have a resolution for this vulnerability.
CVE-2017-2313||Juniper Networks devices running affected Junos OS versions may be impacted by the receipt of a crafted BGP UPDATE which can lead to an rpd (routing process daemon) crash and restart. Repeated crashes of the rpd daemon can result in an extended denial of service condition. The affected Junos OS versions are: 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S15, 15.1F5-S7, 15.1F6-S5, 15.1F7, 15.1R4-S7, 15.1R5-S2, 15.1R6; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D78, 15.1X49-D80; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D230, 15.1X53-D63, 15.1X53-D70; 16.1 prior to 16.1R3-S3, 16.1R4; 16.2 prior to 16.2R1-S3, 16.2R2; Releases prior to Junos OS 15.1 are unaffected by this vulnerability. 17.1R1, 17.2R1, and all subsequent releases have a resolution for this vulnerability.

CVE-2017-2343||The Integrated User Firewall (UserFW) feature was introduced in Junos OS version 12.1X47-D10 on the Juniper SRX Series devices to provide simple integration of user profiles on top of the existing firewall polices. As part of an internal security review of the UserFW services authentication API, hardcoded credentials were identified and removed which can impact both the SRX Series device, and potentially LDAP and Active Directory integrated points. An attacker may be able to completely compromise SRX Series devices, as well as Active Directory servers and services. When Active Directory is compromised, it may allow access to user credentials, workstations, servers performing other functions such as email, database, etc. Inter-Forest Active Directory deployments may also be at risk as the attacker may gain full administrative control over one or more Active Directories depending on the credentials supplied by the administrator of the AD domains and SRX devices performing integrated authentication of users, groups and devices. To identify if your device is potentially vulnerable to exploitation, check to see if the service is operating; from CLI review the following output: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access domain-controller status extensive A result of "Status: Connected" will indicate that the service is active on the device. To evaluate if user authentication is occurring through the device: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access active-directory-authentication-table all Next review the results to see if valid users and groups are returned. e.g. Domain: juniperlab.com Total entries: 3 Source IP Username groups state 172.16.26.1 administrator Valid 192.168.26.2 engg01 engineers Valid 192.168.26.3 guest01 guests Valid Domain: NULL Total entries: 8 Source IP Username groups state 192.168.26.4 Invalid 192.168.26.5 Invalid This will also indicate that Valid users and groups are authenticating through the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 from 12.3X48-D30 and prior to 12.3X48-D35 on SRX series; 15.1X49 from 15.1X49-D40 and prior to 15.1X49-D50 on SRX series.

CVE-2017-3157||By exploiting the way Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.4 renders embedded objects, an attacker could craft a document that allows reading in a file from the user's filesystem. Information could be retrieved by the attacker by, e.g., using hidden sections to store the information, tricking the user into saving the document and convincing the user to send the document back to the attacker. The vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know the precise file path in the target system, and the need to trick the user into saving the document and sending it back.
CVE-2017-3158||A race condition in Guacamole's terminal emulator in versions 0.9.5 through 0.9.10-incubating could allow writes of blocks of printed data to overlap. Such overlapping writes could cause packet data to be misread as the packet length, resulting in the remaining data being written beyond the end of a statically-allocated buffer.
CVE-2017-3159||Apache Camel's camel-snakeyaml component is vulnerable to Java object de-serialization vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws.
CVE-2017-3160||After the Android platform is added to Cordova the first time, or after a project is created using the build scripts, the scripts will fetch Gradle on the first build. However, since the default URI is not using https, it is vulnerable to a MiTM and the Gradle executable is not safe. The severity of this issue is high due to the fact that the build scripts immediately start a build after Gradle has been fetched. Developers who are concerned about this issue should install version 6.1.2 or higher of Cordova-Android. If developers are unable to install the latest version, this vulnerability can easily be mitigated by setting the CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL environment variable to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip
CVE-2017-3161||The HDFS web UI in Apache Hadoop before 2.7.0 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through an unescaped query parameter.

CVE-2017-3163||When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull index files from a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name. However, Solr before 5.5.4 and 6.x before 6.4.1 did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a special request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules and/or authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users would gain direct HTTP access.
CVE-2017-3164||Server Side Request Forgery in Apache Solr, versions 1.3 until 7.6 (inclusive). Since the "shards" parameter does not have a corresponding whitelist mechanism, a remote attacker with access to the server could make Solr perform an HTTP GET request to any reachable URL.
CVE-2017-3165||In Apache Brooklyn before 0.10.0, the REST server is vulnerable to cross-site scripting where one authenticated user can cause scripts to run in the browser of another user authorized to access the first user's resources. This is due to improper escaping of server-side content. There is known to be a proof-of-concept exploit using this vulnerability.
CVE-2017-3166||In Apache Hadoop versions 2.6.1 to 2.6.5, 2.7.0 to 2.7.3, and 3.0.0-alpha1, if a file in an encryption zone with access permissions that make it world readable is localized via YARN's localization mechanism, that file will be stored in a world-readable location and can be shared freely with any application that requests to localize that file.
CVE-2017-3167||In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, use of the ap_get_basic_auth_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed.

The issue was originally identified by the researcher in firmware version DH_IPC-HX1X2X-Themis_EngSpnFrn_N_V2.400.0000.30.R.20160803.
CVE-2017-3224||Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol implementations may improperly determine Link State Advertisement (LSA) recency for LSAs with MaxSequenceNumber. According to RFC 2328 section 13.1, for two instances of the same LSA, recency is determined by first comparing sequence numbers, then checksums, and finally MaxAge. In a case where the sequence numbers are the same, the LSA with the larger checksum is considered more recent, and will not be flushed from the Link State Database (LSDB). Since the RFC does not explicitly state that the values of links carried by a LSA must be the same when prematurely aging a self-originating LSA with MaxSequenceNumber, it is possible in vulnerable OSPF implementations for an attacker to craft a LSA with MaxSequenceNumber and invalid links that will result in a larger checksum and thus a 'newer' LSA that will not be flushed from the LSDB. Propagation of the crafted LSA can result in the erasure or alteration of the routing tables of routers within the routing domain, creating a denial of service condition or the re-routing of traffic on the network. CVE-2017-3224 has been reserved for Quagga and downstream implementations (SUSE, openSUSE, and Red Hat packages).
CVE-2017-3225||Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an AES encrypted file. For devices utilizing this environment encryption mode, U-Boot's use of a zero initialization vector may allow attacks against the underlying cryptographic implementation and allow an attacker to decrypt the data. Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature uses a zero (0) initialization vector. This allows an attacker to perform dictionary attacks on encrypted data produced by Das U-Boot to learn information about the encrypted data.
CVE-2017-3226||Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an AES encrypted file. Devices that make use of Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature using environment encryption (i.e., setting the configuration parameter CONFIG_ENV_AES=y) read environment variables from disk as the encrypted disk image is processed. An attacker with physical access to the device can manipulate the encrypted environment data to include a crafted two-byte sequence which triggers an error in environment variable parsing. This error condition is improperly handled by Das U-Boot, resulting in an immediate process termination with a debugging message.
