CVE-2019-6465||Controls for zone transfers may not be properly applied to Dynamically Loadable Zones (DLZs) if the zones are writable Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.5-P2, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.3-P2, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition. Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2019-6465.
CVE-2019-6466||** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. Reason: The CNA or individual who requested this candidate did not associate it with any vulnerability during 2019.
CVE-2019-6467||A programming error in the nxdomain-redirect feature can cause an assertion failure in query.c if the alternate namespace used by nxdomain-redirect is a descendant of a zone that is served locally. The most likely scenario where this might occur is if the server, in addition to performing NXDOMAIN redirection for recursive clients, is also serving a local copy of the root zone or using mirroring to provide the root zone, although other configurations are also possible. Versions affected: BIND 9.12.0-> 9.12.4, 9.14.0. Also affects all releases in the 9.13 development branch.
CVE-2019-6468||In BIND Supported Preview Edition, an error in the nxdomain-redirect feature can occur in versions which support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) features. In those versions which have ECS support, enabling nxdomain-redirect is likely to lead to BIND exiting due to assertion failure. Versions affected: BIND Supported Preview Edition version 9.10.5-S1 -> 9.11.5-S5. ONLY BIND Supported Preview Edition releases are affected.
CVE-2019-6469||An error in the EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) feature for recursive resolvers can cause BIND to exit with an assertion failure when processing a response that has malformed RRSIGs. Versions affected: BIND 9.10.5-S1 -> 9.11.6-S1 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.
CVE-2019-6470||There had existed in one of the ISC BIND libraries a bug in a function that was used by dhcpd when operating in DHCPv6 mode. There was also a bug in dhcpd relating to the use of this function per its documentation, but the bug in the library function prevented this from causing any harm. All releases of dhcpd from ISC contain copies of this, and other, BIND libraries in combinations that have been tested prior to release and are known to not present issues like this. Some third-party packagers of ISC software have modified the dhcpd source, BIND source, or version matchup in ways that create the crash potential. Based on reports available to ISC, the crash probability is large and no analysis has been done on how, or even if, the probability can be manipulated by an attacker. Affects: Builds of dhcpd versions prior to version 4.4.1 when using BIND versions 9.11.2 or later, or BIND versions with specific bug fixes backported to them. ISC does not have access to comprehensive version lists for all repackagings of dhcpd that are vulnerable. In particular, builds from other vendors may also be affected. Operators are advised to consult their vendor documentation.
CVE-2019-6471||A race condition which may occur when discarding malformed packets can result in BIND exiting due to a REQUIRE assertion failure in dispatch.c. Versions affected: BIND 9.11.0 -> 9.11.7, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.4-P1, 9.14.0 -> 9.14.2. Also all releases of the BIND 9.13 development branch and version 9.15.0 of the BIND 9.15 development branch and BIND Supported Preview Edition versions 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.7-S1.
CVE-2019-6472||A packet containing a malformed DUID can cause the Kea DHCPv6 server process (kea-dhcp6) to exit due to an assertion failure. Versions affected: 1.4.0 to 1.5.0, 1.6.0-beta1, and 1.6.0-beta2.
CVE-2019-6473||An invalid hostname option can trigger an assertion failure in the Kea DHCPv4 server process (kea-dhcp4), causing the server process to exit. Versions affected: 1.4.0 to 1.5.0, 1.6.0-beta1, and 1.6.0-beta2.
CVE-2019-6474||A missing check on incoming client requests can be exploited to cause a situation where the Kea server's lease storage contains leases which are rejected as invalid when the server tries to load leases from storage on restart. If the number of such leases exceeds a hard-coded limit in the Kea code, a server trying to restart will conclude that there is a problem with its lease store and give up. Versions affected: 1.4.0 to 1.5.0, 1.6.0-beta1, and 1.6.0-beta2
CVE-2019-6475||Mirror zones are a BIND feature allowing recursive servers to pre-cache zone data provided by other servers. A mirror zone is similar to a zone of type secondary, except that its data is subject to DNSSEC validation before being used in answers, as if it had been looked up via traditional recursion, and when mirror zone data cannot be validated, BIND falls back to using traditional recursion instead of the mirror zone. However, an error in the validity checks for the incoming zone data can allow an on-path attacker to replace zone data that was validated with a configured trust anchor with forged data of the attacker's choosing. The mirror zone feature is most often used to serve a local copy of the root zone. If an attacker was able to insert themselves into the network path between a recursive server using a mirror zone and a root name server, this vulnerability could then be used to cause the recursive server to accept a copy of falsified root zone data. This affects BIND versions 9.14.0 up to 9.14.6, and 9.15.0 up to 9.15.4.
CVE-2019-6476||A defect in code added to support QNAME minimization can cause named to exit with an assertion failure if a forwarder returns a referral rather than resolving the query. This affects BIND versions 9.14.0 up to 9.14.6, and 9.15.0 up to 9.15.4.
CVE-2019-6477||With pipelining enabled each incoming query on a TCP connection requires a similar resource allocation to a query received via UDP or via TCP without pipelining enabled. A client using a TCP-pipelined connection to a server could consume more resources than the server has been provisioned to handle. When a TCP connection with a large number of pipelined queries is closed, the load on the server releasing these multiple resources can cause it to become unresponsive, even for queries that can be answered authoritatively or from cache. (This is most likely to be perceived as an intermittent server problem).

CVE-2019-7225||The ABB HMI components implement hidden administrative accounts that are used during the provisioning phase of the HMI interface. These credentials allow the provisioning tool "Panel Builder 600" to flash a new interface and Tags (MODBUS coils) mapping to the HMI. These credentials are the idal123 password for the IdalMaster account, and the exor password for the exor account. These credentials are used over both HTTP(S) and FTP. There is no option to disable or change these undocumented credentials. An attacker can use these credentials to login to ABB HMI to read/write HMI configuration files and also to reset the device. This affects ABB CP635 HMI, CP600 HMIClient, Panel Builder 600, IDAL FTP server, IDAL HTTP server, and multiple other HMI components.
CVE-2019-7226||The ABB IDAL HTTP server CGI interface contains a URL that allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to privileged functions. Specifically, /cgi/loginDefaultUser creates a session in an authenticated state and returns the session ID along with what may be the username and cleartext password of the user. An attacker can then supply an IDALToken value in a cookie, which will allow them to perform privileged operations such as restarting the service with /cgi/restart. A GET request to /cgi/loginDefaultUser may result in "1 #S_OK IDALToken=532c8632b86694f0232a68a0897a145c admin admin" or a similar response.
CVE-2019-7227||In the ABB IDAL FTP server, an authenticated attacker can traverse to arbitrary directories on the hard disk with "CWD ../" and then use the FTP server functionality to download and upload files. An unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of the hardcoded or default credential pair exor/exor to become an authenticated attacker.
CVE-2019-7228||The ABB IDAL HTTP server mishandles format strings in a username or cookie during the authentication process. Attempting to authenticate with the username %25s%25p%25x%25n will crash the server. Sending %08x.AAAA.%08x.%08x will log memory content from the stack.
CVE-2019-7229||The ABB CP635 HMI uses two different transmission methods to upgrade its firmware and its software components: "Utilization of USB/SD Card to flash the device" and "Remote provisioning process via ABB Panel Builder 600 over FTP." Neither of these transmission methods implements any form of encryption or authenticity checks against the new firmware HMI software binary files.
CVE-2019-7230||The ABB IDAL FTP server mishandles format strings in a username during the authentication process. Attempting to authenticate with the username %s%p%x%d will crash the server. Sending %08x.AAAA.%08x.%08x will log memory content from the stack.
CVE-2019-7231||The ABB IDAL FTP server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when a long string is sent by an authenticated attacker. This overflow is handled, but terminates the process. An authenticated attacker can send a FTP command string of 472 bytes or more to overflow a buffer, causing an exception that terminates the server.
CVE-2019-7232||The ABB IDAL HTTP server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when a long Host header is sent in a web request. The Host header value overflows a buffer and overwrites a Structured Exception Handler (SEH) address. An unauthenticated attacker can submit a Host header value of 2047 bytes or more to overflow the buffer and overwrite the SEH address, which can then be leveraged to execute attacker-controlled code on the server.
