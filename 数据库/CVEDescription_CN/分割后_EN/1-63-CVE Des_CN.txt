CVE-2022-2053||When a POST request comes through AJP and the request exceeds the max-post-size limit (maxEntitySize), Undertow's AjpServerRequestConduit implementation closes a connection without sending any response to the client/proxy. This behavior results in that a front-end proxy marking the backend worker (application server) as an error state and not forward requests to the worker for a while. In mod_cluster, this continues until the next STATUS request (10 seconds intervals) from the application server updates the server state. So, in the worst case, it can result in "All workers are in error state" and mod_cluster responds "503 Service Unavailable" for a while (up to 10 seconds). In mod_proxy_balancer, it does not forward requests to the worker until the "retry" timeout passes. However, luckily, mod_proxy_balancer has "forcerecovery" setting (On by default; this parameter can force the immediate recovery of all workers without considering the retry parameter of the workers if all workers of a balancer are in error state.). So, unlike mod_cluster, mod_proxy_balancer does not result in responding "503 Service Unavailable". An attacker could use this behavior to send a malicious request and trigger server errors, resulting in DoS (denial of service). This flaw was fixed in Undertow 2.2.19.Final, Undertow 2.3.0.Alpha2.

CVE-2022-20866||A vulnerability in the handling of RSA keys on devices running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve an RSA private key. This vulnerability is due to a logic error when the RSA key is stored in memory on a hardware platform that performs hardware-based cryptography. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a Lenstra side-channel attack against the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the RSA private key. The following conditions may be observed on an affected device: This vulnerability will apply to approximately 5 percent of the RSA keys on a device that is running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software; not all RSA keys are expected to be affected due to mathematical calculations applied to the RSA key. The RSA key could be valid but have specific characteristics that make it vulnerable to the potential leak of the RSA private key. If an attacker obtains the RSA private key, they could use the key to impersonate a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software or to decrypt the device traffic. See the Indicators of Compromise section for more information on the detection of this type of RSA key. The RSA key could be malformed and invalid. A malformed RSA key is not functional, and a TLS client connection to a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software that uses the malformed RSA key will result in a TLS signature failure, which means a vulnerable software release created an invalid RSA signature that failed verification. If an attacker obtains the RSA private key, they could use the key to impersonate a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software or to decrypt the device traffic.

CVE-2022-21646||SpiceDB is a database system for managing security-critical application permissions. Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion` or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return a resource as "accessible" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the exclusion. In `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the exclusion. Version 1.4.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, don't make use of wildcards on the right side of intersections or within exclusions.
CVE-2022-21647||CodeIgniter is an open source PHP full-stack web framework. Deserialization of Untrusted Data was found in the `old()` function in CodeIgniter4. Remote attackers may inject auto-loadable arbitrary objects with this vulnerability, and possibly execute existing PHP code on the server. We are aware of a working exploit, which can lead to SQL injection. Users are advised to upgrade to v4.1.6 or later. Users unable to upgrade as advised to not use the `old()` function and form_helper nor `RedirectResponse::withInput()` and `redirect()->withInput()`.
CVE-2022-21648||Latte is an open source template engine for PHP. Versions since 2.8.0 Latte has included a template sandbox and in affected versions it has been found that a sandbox escape exists allowing for injection into web pages generated from Latte. This may lead to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in the versions 2.8.8, 2.9.6 and 2.10.8. Users unable to upgrade should not accept template input from untrusted sources.
CVE-2022-21649||Convos is an open source multi-user chat that runs in a web browser. Characters starting with "https://" in the chat window create an <a> tag. Stored XSS vulnerability using onfocus and autofocus occurs because escaping exists for "<" or ">" but escaping for double quotes does not exist. Through this vulnerability, an attacker is capable to execute malicious scripts. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.
CVE-2022-2165||Insufficient data validation in URL formatting in Google Chrome prior to 103.0.5060.53 allowed a remote attacker to perform domain spoofing via IDN homographs via a crafted domain name.
CVE-2022-21650||Convos is an open source multi-user chat that runs in a web browser. You can't use SVG extension in Convos' chat window, but you can upload a file with an .html extension. By uploading an SVG file with an html extension the upload filter can be bypassed. This causes Stored XSS. Also, after uploading a file the XSS attack is triggered upon a user viewing the file. Through this vulnerability, an attacker is capable to execute malicious scripts. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.
CVE-2022-21651||Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform. An open redirect vulnerability has been discovered. Users may be arbitrary redirected due to incomplete URL handling in the shopware router. This issue has been resolved in version 5.7.7. There is no workaround and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
CVE-2022-21652||Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform. In affected versions shopware would not invalidate a user session in the event of a password change. With version 5.7.7 the session validation was adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password change of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This also means, that upon a password change, all existing sessions for a given customer account are automatically considered invalid. There is no workaround for this issue.
CVE-2022-21653||Jawn is an open source JSON parser. Extenders of the `org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade` and `org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who don't override `objectContext()` are vulnerable to a hash collision attack which may result in a denial of service. Most applications do not implement these traits directly, but inherit from a library. `jawn-parser-1.3.1` fixes this issue and users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade override `objectContext()` to use a collision-safe collection.
CVE-2022-21654||Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. Envoy's tls allows re-use when some cert validation settings have changed from their default configuration. The only workaround for this issue is to ensure that default tls settings are used. Users are advised to upgrade.
CVE-2022-21655||Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. The envoy common router will segfault if an internal redirect selects a route configured with direct response or redirect actions. This will result in a denial of service. As a workaround turn off internal redirects if direct response entries are configured on the same listener.
CVE-2022-21656||Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. The default_validator.cc implementation used to implement the default certificate validation routines has a "type confusion" bug when processing subjectAltNames. This processing allows, for example, an rfc822Name or uniformResourceIndicator to be authenticated as a domain name. This confusion allows for the bypassing of nameConstraints, as processed by the underlying OpenSSL/BoringSSL implementation, exposing the possibility of impersonation of arbitrary servers. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted.
CVE-2022-21657||Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. In affected versions Envoy does not restrict the set of certificates it accepts from the peer, either as a TLS client or a TLS server, to only those certificates that contain the necessary extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth, respectively). This means that a peer may present an e-mail certificate (e.g. id-kp-emailProtection), either as a leaf certificate or as a CA in the chain, and it will be accepted for TLS. This is particularly bad when combined with the issue described in pull request #630, in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended only for use with S/MIME, and thus exempted from audit or supervision, to issue TLS certificates that will be accepted by Envoy. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted. There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.
CVE-2022-21658||Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.
CVE-2022-21659||Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of the Flask web framework. In affected versions there exists a user enumeration vulnerability. This vulnerability allows for a non authenticated user to enumerate existing accounts by timing the response time from the server when you are logging in. Users are advised to upgrade to version 3.4.4 as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-2166||Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts in GitHub repository mastodon/mastodon prior to 4.0.0.
CVE-2022-21660||Gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin. In versions prior to 2.4.7 low privilege users are able to modify higher privilege users. Authentication is missing on the `setUserInfo` function. Users are advised to update as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-21661||WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MariaDB database. Due to improper sanitization in WP_Query, there can be cases where SQL injection is possible through plugins or themes that use it in a certain way. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.8.3. Older affected versions are also fixed via security release, that go back till 3.7.37. We strongly recommend that you keep auto-updates enabled. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
CVE-2022-21662||WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MariaDB database. Low-privileged authenticated users (like author) in WordPress core are able to execute JavaScript/perform stored XSS attack, which can affect high-privileged users. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.8.3. Older affected versions are also fixed via security release, that go back till 3.7.37. We strongly recommend that you keep auto-updates enabled. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21663||WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MariaDB database. On a multisite, users with Super Admin role can bypass explicit/additional hardening under certain conditions through object injection. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.8.3. Older affected versions are also fixed via security release, that go back till 3.7.37. We strongly recommend that you keep auto-updates enabled. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21664||WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MariaDB database. Due to lack of proper sanitization in one of the classes, there's potential for unintended SQL queries to be executed. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.8.3. Older affected versions are also fixed via security release, that go back till 4.1.34. We strongly recommend that you keep auto-updates enabled. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21666||Useful Simple Open-Source CMS (USOC) is a content management system (CMS) for programmers. Versions prior to Pb2.4Bfx3 allowed Sql injection in usersearch.php only for users with administrative privileges. Users should replace the file `admin/pages/useredit.php` with a newer version. USOC version Pb2.4Bfx3 contains a fixed version of `admin/pages/useredit.php`.
CVE-2022-21667||soketi is an open-source WebSockets server. There is an unhandled case when reading POST requests which results in the server crashing if it could not read the body of a request. In the event that a POST request is sent to any endpoint of the server with an empty body, even unauthenticated with the Pusher Protocol, it will crash the server. All users that run the server are affected by this vulnerability and it's highly recommended to upgrade to the latest patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21668||pipenv is a Python development workflow tool. Starting with version 2018.10.9 and prior to version 2022.1.8, a flaw in pipenv's parsing of requirements files allows an attacker to insert a specially crafted string inside a comment anywhere within a requirements.txt file, which will cause victims who use pipenv to install the requirements file to download dependencies from a package index server controlled by the attacker. By embedding malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server, the attacker can trigger arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on the victims' systems. If an attacker is able to hide a malicious `--index-url` option in a requirements file that a victim installs with pipenv, the attacker can embed arbitrary malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server that will be executed on the victim's host during installation (remote code execution/RCE). When pip installs from a source distribution, any code in the setup.py is executed by the install process. This issue is patched in version 2022.1.8. The GitHub Security Advisory contains more information about this vulnerability.
CVE-2022-21669||PuddingBot is a group management bot. In version 0.0.6-b933652 and prior, the bot token is publicly exposed in main.py, making it accessible to malicious actors. The bot token has been revoked and new version is already running on the server. As of time of publication, the maintainers are planning to update code to reflect this change at a later date.
CVE-2022-2167||The Newspaper WordPress theme before 12 does not sanitise a parameter before outputting it back in an HTML attribute via an AJAX action, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
CVE-2022-21670||markdown-it is a Markdown parser. Prior to version 1.3.2, special patterns with length greater than 50 thousand characterss could slow down the parser significantly. Users should upgrade to version 12.3.2 to receive a patch. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
CVE-2022-21671||@replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit's container protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive information exists in versions prior to 7.3.1. When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server that is outside of Replit's control and the token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched in version 7.3.1 by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new one. As a workaround, a user may specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
CVE-2022-21672||make-ca is a utility to deliver and manage a complete PKI configuration for workstations and servers. Starting with version 0.9 and prior to version 1.10, make-ca misinterprets Mozilla certdata.txt and treats explicitly untrusted certificates like trusted ones, causing those explicitly untrusted certificates trusted by the system. The explicitly untrusted certificates were used by some CAs already hacked. Hostile attackers may perform a MIM attack exploiting them. Everyone using the affected versions of make-ca should upgrade to make-ca-1.10, and run `make-ca -f -g` as the `root` user to regenerate the trusted store immediately. As a workaround, users may delete the untrusted certificates from /etc/pki/tls and /etc/ssl/certs manually (or by a script), but this is not recommended because the manual changes will be overwritten next time running make-ca to update the trusted anchor.
CVE-2022-21673||Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions when a data source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API token (and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently logged-in user. This can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which they may not have intended access. This attack relies on the Grafana instance having data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity feature, the Grafana instance having a data source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on, the Grafana instance having OAuth enabled, and the Grafana instance having usable API keys. This issue has been patched in versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4.
CVE-2022-21675||Bytecode Viewer (BCV) is a Java/Android reverse engineering suite. Versions of the package prior to 2.11.0 are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA "Zip Slip"). The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.exe). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including zip, jar, tar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victimâ€™s machine. The impact of a Zip Slip vulnerability would allow an attacker to create or overwrite existing files on the filesystem. In the context of a web application, a web shell could be placed within the application directory to achieve code execution. All users should upgrade to BCV v2.11.0 when possible to receive a patch. There are no recommended workarounds aside from upgrading.
CVE-2022-21676||Engine.IO is the implementation of transport-based cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the `engine.io` package starting from version `4.0.0`, including those who uses depending packages like `socket.io`. Versions prior to `4.0.0` are not impacted. A fix has been released for each major branch, namely `4.1.2` for the `4.x.x` branch, `5.2.1` for the `5.x.x` branch, and `6.1.1` for the `6.x.x` branch. There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.
CVE-2022-21677||Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Discourse groups can be configured with varying visibility levels for the group as well as the group members. By default, a newly created group has its visibility set to public and the group's members visibility set to public as well. However, a group's visibility and the group's members visibility can be configured such that it is restricted to logged on users, members of the group or staff users. A vulnerability has been discovered in versions prior to 2.7.13 and 2.8.0.beta11 where the group advanced search option does not respect the group's visibility and members visibility level. As such, a group with restricted visibility or members visibility can be revealed through search with the right search option. This issue is patched in `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11 versions of Discourse. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.
CVE-2022-21678||Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `tests-passed` branch, version 2.8.0.beta11 in the `beta` branch, and version 2.7.13 in the `stable` branch, the bios of users who made their profiles private were still visible in the `<meta>` tags on their users' pages. The problem is patched in `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `stable` version 2.7.13 of Discourse.
CVE-2022-21679||Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In Istio 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 The authorization policy with hosts and notHosts might be accidentally bypassed for ALLOW action or rejected unexpectedly for DENY action during the upgrade from 1.11 to 1.12.0/1.12.1. Istio 1.12 supports the hosts and notHosts fields in authorization policy with a new Envoy API shipped with the 1.12 data plane. A bug in the 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 incorrectly uses the new Envoy API with the 1.11 data plane. This will cause the hosts and notHosts fields to be always matched regardless of the actual value of the host header when mixing 1.12.0/1.12.1 control plane and 1.11 data plane. Users are advised to upgrade or to not mix the 1.12.0/1.12.1 control plane with 1.11 data plane if using hosts or notHosts field in authorization policy.
CVE-2022-2168||The Download Manager WordPress plugin before 3.2.44 does not escape a generated URL before outputting it back in an attribute of the history dashboard, leading to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
CVE-2022-21680||Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `block.def` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.
CVE-2022-21681||Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.
CVE-2022-21682||Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. A path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. At this point the build directory will have the full access that is specified in the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against it will gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done, so this is not problem. However, if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified, then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after finalization, which can lead to issues even with the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only issue is that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write permissions. However, a malicious application could replace the `appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.
CVE-2022-21683||Wagtail is a Django based content management system focused on flexibility and user experience. When notifications for new replies in comment threads are sent, they are sent to all users who have replied or commented anywhere on the site, rather than only in the relevant threads. This means that a user could listen in to new comment replies on pages they have not have editing access to, as long as they have left a comment or reply somewhere on the site. A patched version has been released as Wagtail 2.15.2, which restores the intended behaviour - to send notifications for new replies to the participants in the active thread only (editing permissions are not considered). New comments can be disabled by setting `WAGTAILADMIN_COMMENTS_ENABLED = False` in the Django settings file.
CVE-2022-21684||Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.
CVE-2022-21685||Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number `8a93fdc6c9f4eb1d2f2a11b7ff1d12d70bf5a664`, a bug in Frontier's MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer underflow in certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds. For release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is limited as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. Users who do not use MODEXP precompile in their runtime are not impacted. A patch is available in pull request #549.
CVE-2022-21686||PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce platform. Starting with version 1.7.0.0 and ending with version 1.7.8.3, an attacker is able to inject twig code inside the back office when using the legacy layout. The problem is fixed in version 1.7.8.3. There are no known workarounds.
CVE-2022-21687||gh-ost is a triggerless online schema migration solution for MySQL. Versions prior to 1.1.3 are subject to an arbitrary file read vulnerability. The attacker must have access to the target host or trick an administrator into executing a malicious gh-ost command on a host running gh-ost, plus network access from host running gh-ost to the attack's malicious MySQL server. The `-database` parameter does not properly sanitize user input which can lead to arbitrary file reads.
CVE-2022-21688||OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. Affected versions of the desktop application were found to be vulnerable to denial of service via an undisclosed vulnerability in the QT image parsing. Roughly 20 bytes lead to 2GB memory consumption and this can be triggered multiple times. To be abused, this vulnerability requires rendering in the history tab, so some user interaction is required. An adversary with knowledge of the Onion service address in public mode or with authentication in private mode can perform a Denial of Service attack, which quickly results in out-of-memory for the server. This requires the desktop application with rendered history, therefore the impact is only elevated. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.
CVE-2022-21689||OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions the receive mode limits concurrent uploads to 100 per second and blocks other uploads in the same second, which can be triggered by a simple script. An adversary with access to the receive mode can block file upload for others. There is no way to block this attack in public mode due to the anonymity properties of the tor network.
CVE-2022-2169||The Loading Page with Loading Screen WordPress plugin before 1.0.83 does not escape its settings, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.
CVE-2022-21690||OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions The path parameter of the requested URL is not sanitized before being passed to the QT frontend. This path is used in all components for displaying the server access history. This leads to a rendered HTML4 Subset (QT RichText editor) in the Onionshare frontend.
CVE-2022-21691||OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions chat participants can spoof their channel leave message, tricking others into assuming they left the chatroom.
CVE-2022-21692||OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions anyone with access to the chat environment can write messages disguised as another chat participant.
CVE-2022-21693||OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions an adversary with a primitive that allows for filesystem access from the context of the Onionshare process can access sensitive files in the entire user home folder. This could lead to the leaking of sensitive data. Due to the automatic exclusion of hidden folders, the impact is reduced. This can be mitigated by usage of the flatpak release.
CVE-2022-21694||OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. The website mode of the onionshare allows to use a hardened CSP, which will block any scripts and external resources. It is not possible to configure this CSP for individual pages and therefore the security enhancement cannot be used for websites using javascript or external resources like fonts or images.
CVE-2022-21695||OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions authenticated users (or unauthenticated in public mode) can send messages without being visible in the list of chat participants. This issue has been resolved in version 2.5.
CVE-2022-21696||OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions it is possible to change the username to that of another chat participant with an additional space character at the end of the name string. An adversary with access to the chat environment can use the rename feature to impersonate other participants by adding whitespace characters at the end of the username.
CVE-2022-21697||Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy web services. Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled is affected. A lack of input validation allows authenticated clients to proxy requests to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication is required, which already grants permissions to make the same requests via kernel or terminal execution, this is considered low to moderate severity. Users may upgrade to version 3.2.1 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, install the patch manually.
CVE-2022-21698||client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.
CVE-2022-21699||IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Affected versions are subject to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability achieved by not properly managing cross user temporary files. This vulnerability allows one user to run code as another on the same machine. All users are advised to upgrade.
CVE-2022-2170||The Microsoft Advertising Universal Event Tracking (UET) WordPress plugin before 1.0.4 does not sanitise and escape its settings, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed. Due to the nature of this plugin, well crafted XSS can also leak into the frontpage.

CVE-2022-21701||Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.
CVE-2022-21702||Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions an attacker could serve HTML content thru the Grafana datasource or plugin proxy and trick a user to visit this HTML page using a specially crafted link and execute a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. The attacker could either compromise an existing datasource for a specific Grafana instance or either set up its own public service and instruct anyone to set it up in their Grafana instance. To be impacted, all of the following must be applicable. For the data source proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based datasource configured with Server as Access Mode and a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above datasource, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled data source must be clicked on by an authenticated user. For the plugin proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based app plugin configured and enabled with a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above app, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled plugin must be clocked on by an authenticated user. For the backend plugin resource: An attacker must be able to navigate an authenticated user to a compromised plugin through a crafted link. Users are advised to update to a patched version. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
CVE-2022-21703||Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Affected versions are subject to a cross site request forgery vulnerability which allows attackers to elevate their privileges by mounting cross-origin attacks against authenticated high-privilege Grafana users (for example, Editors or Admins). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation by tricking an authenticated user into inviting the attacker as a new user with high privileges. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21704||log4js-node is a port of log4js to node.js. In affected versions default file permissions for log files created by the file, fileSync and dateFile appenders are world-readable (in unix).

Users are advised to update.
CVE-2022-21705||Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually.
CVE-2022-21706||Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with topic-based threading. Zulip Server version 2.0.0 and above are vulnerable to insufficient access control with multi-use invitations. A Zulip Server deployment which hosts multiple organizations is vulnerable to an attack where an invitation created in one organization (potentially as a role with elevated permissions) can be used to join any other organization. This bypasses any restrictions on required domains on users' email addresses, may be used to gain access to organizations which are only accessible by invitation, and may be used to gain access with elevated privileges. This issue has been patched in release 4.10. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ### Patches _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_ ### Workarounds _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_ ### References _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_ ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you can discuss them on the [developer community Zulip server](https://zulip.com/developer-community/), or email the [Zulip security team](mailto:security@zulip.com).
CVE-2022-21707||wasmCloud Host Runtime is a server process that securely hosts and provides dispatch for web assembly (WASM) actors and capability providers. In versions prior to 0.52.2 actors can bypass capability authorization. Actors are normally required to declare their capabilities for inbound invocations, but with this vulnerability actor capability claims are not verified upon receiving invocations. This compromises the security model for actors as they can receive unauthorized invocations from linked capability providers. The problem has been patched in versions `0.52.2` and greater. There is no workaround and users are advised to upgrade to an unaffected version as soon as possible.
CVE-2022-21708||graphql-go is a GraphQL server with a focus on ease of use. In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.
CVE-2022-2171||The Progressive License WordPress plugin through 1.1.0 is lacking any CSRF check when saving its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them. Furthermore, as the plugin allows arbitrary HTML to be inserted in one of the settings, this could lead to Stored XSS issue which will be triggered in the frontend as well.
CVE-2022-21710||ShortDescription is a MediaWiki extension that provides local short description support. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.3.4. On a wiki that has the ShortDescription enabled, XSS can be triggered on any page or the page with the action=info parameter, which displays the shortdesc property. This is achieved using the wikitext `{{SHORTDESC:&lt;img src=x onerror=alert()&gt;}}`. This issue has a patch in version 2.3.4.

CVE-2022-21724||pgjdbc is the offical PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. A security hole was found in the jdbc driver for postgresql database while doing security research. The system using the postgresql library will be attacked when attacker control the jdbc url or properties. pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based on class names provided via `authenticationPluginClassName`, `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties. However, the driver did not verify if the class implements the expected interface before instantiating the class. This can lead to code execution loaded via arbitrary classes. Users using plugins are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2022-21725||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The estimator for the cost of some convolution operations can be made to execute a division by 0. The function fails to check that the stride argument is strictly positive. Hence, the fix is to add a check for the stride argument to ensure it is valid. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21726||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `Dequantize` does not fully validate the value of `axis` and can result in heap OOB accesses. The `axis` argument can be `-1` (the default value for the optional argument) or any other positive value at most the number of dimensions of the input. Unfortunately, the upper bound is not checked and this results in reading past the end of the array containing the dimensions of the input tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21727||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of shape inference for `Dequantize` is vulnerable to an integer overflow weakness. The `axis` argument can be `-1` (the default value for the optional argument) or any other positive value at most the number of dimensions of the input. Unfortunately, the upper bound is not checked, and, since the code computes `axis + 1`, an attacker can trigger an integer overflow. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21728||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of shape inference for `ReverseSequence` does not fully validate the value of `batch_dim` and can result in a heap OOB read. There is a check to make sure the value of `batch_dim` does not go over the rank of the input, but there is no check for negative values. Negative dimensions are allowed in some cases to mimic Python's negative indexing (i.e., indexing from the end of the array), however if the value is too negative then the implementation of `Dim` would access elements before the start of an array. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21729||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `UnravelIndex` is vulnerable to a division by zero caused by an integer overflow bug. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-2173||The Advanced Database Cleaner WordPress plugin before 3.1.1 does not escape numerous generated URLs before outputting them back in href attributes of admin dashboard pages, leading to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
CVE-2022-21730||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid allowing an attacker to read from outside of bounds of heap. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21731||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of shape inference for `ConcatV2` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack via a segfault caused by a type confusion. The `axis` argument is translated into `concat_dim` in the `ConcatShapeHelper` helper function. Then, a value for `min_rank` is computed based on `concat_dim`. This is then used to validate that the `values` tensor has at least the required rank. However, `WithRankAtLeast` receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be represented. Due to the fact that `min_rank` is a 32-bits value and the value of `axis`, the `rank` argument is a negative value, so the error check is bypassed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21732||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `ThreadPoolHandle` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by allocating too much memory. This is because the `num_threads` argument is only checked to not be negative, but there is no upper bound on its value. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21733||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `StringNGrams` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by causing an out of memory condition after an integer overflow. We are missing a validation on `pad_witdh` and that result in computing a negative value for `ngram_width` which is later used to allocate parts of the output. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21734||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `MapStage` is vulnerable a `CHECK`-fail if the key tensor is not a scalar. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21735||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `FractionalMaxPool` can be made to crash a TensorFlow process via a division by 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21736||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `SparseTensorSliceDataset` has an undefined behavior: under certain condition it can be made to dereference a `nullptr` value. The 3 input arguments to `SparseTensorSliceDataset` represent a sparse tensor. However, there are some preconditions that these arguments must satisfy but these are not validated in the implementation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21737||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `*Bincount` operations allows malicious users to cause denial of service by passing in arguments which would trigger a `CHECK`-fail. There are several conditions that the input arguments must satisfy. Some are not caught during shape inference and others are not caught during kernel implementation. This results in `CHECK` failures later when the output tensors get allocated. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21738||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `SparseCountSparseOutput` can be made to crash a TensorFlow process by an integer overflow whose result is then used in a memory allocation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
CVE-2022-21739||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `QuantizedMaxPool` has an undefined behavior where user controlled inputs can trigger a reference binding to null pointer. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

CVE-2022-21741||Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. ### Impact An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero in the implementation of depthwise convolutions. The parameters of the convolution can be user controlled and are also used within a division operation to determine the size of the padding that needs to be added before applying the convolution. There is no check before this division that the divisor is strictly positive. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
