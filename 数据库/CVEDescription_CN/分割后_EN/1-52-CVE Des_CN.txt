CVE-2020-25595||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. The PCI passthrough code improperly uses register data. Code paths in Xen's MSI handling have been identified that act on unsanitized values read back from device hardware registers. While devices strictly compliant with PCI specifications shouldn't be able to affect these registers, experience shows that it's very common for devices to have out-of-spec "backdoor" operations that can affect the result of these reads. A not fully trusted guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded. All versions of Xen supporting PCI passthrough are affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only guests with passed through PCI devices may be able to leverage the vulnerability. Only systems passing through devices with out-of-spec ("backdoor") functionality can cause issues. Experience shows that such out-of-spec functionality is common; unless you have reason to believe that your device does not have such functionality, it's better to assume that it does.
CVE-2020-25596||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. x86 PV guest kernels can experience denial of service via SYSENTER. The SYSENTER instruction leaves various state sanitization activities to software. One of Xen's sanitization paths injects a #GP fault, and incorrectly delivers it twice to the guest. This causes the guest kernel to observe a kernel-privilege #GP fault (typically fatal) rather than a user-privilege #GP fault (usually converted into SIGSEGV/etc.). Malicious or buggy userspace can crash the guest kernel, resulting in a VM Denial of Service. All versions of Xen from 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM platforms are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that support the SYSENTER instruction in 64bit mode are vulnerable. This is believed to be Intel, Centaur, and Shanghai CPUs. AMD and Hygon CPUs are not believed to be vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 PVH / HVM guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.
CVE-2020-25597||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is mishandling of the constraint that once-valid event channels may not turn invalid. Logic in the handling of event channel operations in Xen assumes that an event channel, once valid, will not become invalid over the life time of a guest. However, operations like the resetting of all event channels may involve decreasing one of the bounds checked when determining validity. This may lead to bug checks triggering, crashing the host. An unprivileged guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only systems with untrusted guests permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable. This number depends on the architecture and type of guest. For 32-bit x86 PV guests, this is 1023; for 64-bit x86 PV guests, and for all ARM guests, this number is 4095. Systems where untrusted guests are limited to fewer than this number are not vulnerable. Note that xl and libxl limit max_event_channels to 1023 by default, so systems using exclusively xl, libvirt+libxl, or their own toolstack based on libxl, and not explicitly setting max_event_channels, are not vulnerable.
CVE-2020-25598||An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. There is a missing unlock in the XENMEM_acquire_resource error path. The RCU (Read, Copy, Update) mechanism is a synchronisation primitive. A buggy error path in the XENMEM_acquire_resource exits without releasing an RCU reference, which is conceptually similar to forgetting to unlock a spinlock. A buggy or malicious HVM stubdomain can cause an RCU reference to be leaked. This causes subsequent administration operations, (e.g., CPU offline) to livelock, resulting in a host Denial of Service. The buggy codepath has been present since Xen 4.12. Xen 4.14 and later are vulnerable to the DoS. The side effects are believed to be benign on Xen 4.12 and 4.13, but patches are provided nevertheless. The vulnerability can generally only be exploited by x86 HVM VMs, as these are generally the only type of VM that have a Qemu stubdomain. x86 PV and PVH domains, as well as ARM VMs, typically don't use a stubdomain. Only VMs using HVM stubdomains can exploit the vulnerability. VMs using PV stubdomains, or with emulators running in dom0, cannot exploit the vulnerability.
CVE-2020-25599||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are evtchn_reset() race conditions. Uses of EVTCHNOP_reset (potentially by a guest on itself) or XEN_DOMCTL_soft_reset (by itself covered by XSA-77) can lead to the violation of various internal assumptions. This may lead to out of bounds memory accesses or triggering of bug checks. In particular, x86 PV guests may be able to elevate their privilege to that of the host. Host and guest crashes are also possible, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leaks cannot be ruled out. All Xen versions from 4.5 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.
CVE-2020-2560||Vulnerability in the Siebel UI Framework product of Oracle Siebel CRM (component: SWSE Server). Supported versions that are affected are 19.10 and prior. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Siebel UI Framework. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Siebel UI Framework, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Siebel UI Framework accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.7 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).
CVE-2020-25600||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Out of bounds event channels are available to 32-bit x86 domains. The so called 2-level event channel model imposes different limits on the number of usable event channels for 32-bit x86 domains vs 64-bit or Arm (either bitness) ones. 32-bit x86 domains can use only 1023 channels, due to limited space in their shared (between guest and Xen) information structure, whereas all other domains can use up to 4095 in this model. The recording of the respective limit during domain initialization, however, has occurred at a time where domains are still deemed to be 64-bit ones, prior to actually honoring respective domain properties. At the point domains get recognized as 32-bit ones, the limit didn't get updated accordingly. Due to this misbehavior in Xen, 32-bit domains (including Domain 0) servicing other domains may observe event channel allocations to succeed when they should really fail. Subsequent use of such event channels would then possibly lead to corruption of other parts of the shared info structure. An unprivileged guest may cause another domain, in particular Domain 0, to misbehave. This may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 32-bit domains servicing other domains are vulnerable. Arm systems, as well as x86 64-bit domains, are not vulnerable.
CVE-2020-25601||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a lack of preemption in evtchn_reset() / evtchn_destroy(). In particular, the FIFO event channel model allows guests to have a large number of event channels active at a time. Closing all of these (when resetting all event channels or when cleaning up after the guest) may take extended periods of time. So far, there was no arrangement for preemption at suitable intervals, allowing a CPU to spend an almost unbounded amount of time in the processing of these operations. Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system. All Xen versions are vulnerable in principle. Whether versions 4.3 and older are vulnerable depends on underlying hardware characteristics.
CVE-2020-25602||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. An x86 PV guest can trigger a host OS crash when handling guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE. When a guest accesses certain Model Specific Registers, Xen first reads the value from hardware to use as the basis for auditing the guest access. For the MISC_ENABLE MSR, which is an Intel specific MSR, this MSR read is performed without error handling for a #GP fault, which is the consequence of trying to read this MSR on non-Intel hardware. A buggy or malicious PV guest administrator can crash Xen, resulting in a host Denial of Service. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only Xen versions 4.11 and onwards are vulnerable. 4.10 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that do not implement the MISC_ENABLE MSR (0x1a0) are vulnerable. AMD and Hygon systems do not implement this MSR and are vulnerable. Intel systems do implement this MSR and are not vulnerable. Other manufacturers have not been checked. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 HVM/PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.
CVE-2020-25603||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are missing memory barriers when accessing/allocating an event channel. Event channels control structures can be accessed lockless as long as the port is considered to be valid. Such a sequence is missing an appropriate memory barrier (e.g., smp_*mb()) to prevent both the compiler and CPU from re-ordering access. A malicious guest may be able to cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded. Systems running all versions of Xen are affected. Whether a system is vulnerable will depend on the CPU and compiler used to build Xen. For all systems, the presence and the scope of the vulnerability depend on the precise re-ordering performed by the compiler used to build Xen. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code generation options). GCC documentation clearly suggests that re-ordering is possible. Arm systems will also be vulnerable if the CPU is able to re-order memory access. Please consult your CPU vendor. x86 systems are only vulnerable if a compiler performs re-ordering.
CVE-2020-25604||An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a race condition when migrating timers between x86 HVM vCPUs. When migrating timers of x86 HVM guests between its vCPUs, the locking model used allows for a second vCPU of the same guest (also operating on the timers) to release a lock that it didn't acquire. The most likely effect of the issue is a hang or crash of the hypervisor, i.e., a Denial of Service (DoS). All versions of Xen are affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only x86 HVM guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV and PVH cannot leverage the vulnerability. Only guests with more than one vCPU can exploit the vulnerability.

CVE-2020-25674||WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop with an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the colormap to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the event logger. The patch replaces the hardcoded 256 value with a call to MagickMin() to ensure the proper value is used. This could impact application availability when a specially crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
CVE-2020-25675||In the CropImage() and CropImageToTiles() routines of MagickCore/transform.c, rounding calculations performed on unconstrained pixel offsets was causing undefined behavior in the form of integer overflow and out-of-range values as reported by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Such issues could cause a negative impact to application availability or other problems related to undefined behavior, in cases where ImageMagick processes untrusted input data.

CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.9 (Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L).
CVE-2020-25680||A flaw was found in JBCS httpd in version 2.4.37 SP3, where it uses a back-end worker SSL certificate with the keystore file's ID is 'unknown'. The validation of the certificate whether CN and hostname are matching stopped working and allow connecting to the back-end work. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
CVE-2020-25681||A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the way RRSets are sorted before validating with DNSSEC data. An attacker on the network, who can forge DNS replies such as that they are accepted as valid, could use this flaw to cause a buffer overflow with arbitrary data in a heap memory segment, possibly executing code on the machine. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
CVE-2020-25682||A flaw was found in dnsmasq before 2.83. A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way dnsmasq extract names from DNS packets before validating them with DNSSEC data. An attacker on the network, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause an overflow with arbitrary data in a heap-allocated memory, possibly executing code on the machine. The flaw is in the rfc1035.c:extract_name() function, which writes data to the memory pointed by name assuming MAXDNAME*2 bytes are available in the buffer. However, in some code execution paths, it is possible extract_name() gets passed an offset from the base buffer, thus reducing, in practice, the number of available bytes that can be written in the buffer. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
CVE-2020-25683||A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before it validates the received DNS entries. A remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute memcpy() with a negative size in get_rdata() and cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
CVE-2020-25684||A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in the forward.c:reply_query() if the reply destination address/port is used by the pending forwarded queries. However, it does not use the address/port to retrieve the exact forwarded query, substantially reducing the number of attempts an attacker on the network would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue contrasts with RFC5452, which specifies a query's attributes that all must be used to match a reply. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25685 or CVE-2020-25686, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
CVE-2020-25685||A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in forward.c:reply_query(), which is the forwarded query that matches the reply, by only using a weak hash of the query name. Due to the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is) this flaw allows an off-path attacker to find several different domains all having the same hash, substantially reducing the number of attempts they would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast with RFC5452, which specifies that the query name is one of the attributes of a query that must be used to match a reply. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
CVE-2020-25686||A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When receiving a query, dnsmasq does not check for an existing pending request for the same name and forwards a new request. By default, a maximum of 150 pending queries can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be at most 150 queries for the same name. This flaw allows an off-path attacker on the network to substantially reduce the number of attempts that it would have to perform to forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue is mentioned in the "Birthday Attacks" section of RFC5452. If chained with CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.
CVE-2020-25687||A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before it validates the received DNS entries. This flaw allows a remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute memcpy() with a negative size in sort_rrset() and cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
CVE-2020-25688||A flaw was found in rhacm versions before 2.0.5 and before 2.1.0. Two internal service APIs were incorrectly provisioned using a test certificate from the source repository. This would result in all installations using the same certificates.

CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.0 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).
CVE-2020-26230||Radar COVID is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for Spain. In affected versions of Radar COVID, identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users that upload Radar COVID TEKs to the Radar COVID server is possible. This vulnerability enables the identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users when using Radar COVID. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Radar COVID connections to the server (uploading of TEKs to the backend) are only made by COVID-19 positives. Therefore, any on-path observer with the ability to monitor traffic between the app and the server can identify which users had a positive test. Such an adversary can be the mobile network operator (MNO) if the connection is done through a mobile network, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) if the connection is done through the Internet (e.g., a home network), a VPN provider used by the user, the local network operator in the case of enterprise networks, or any eavesdropper with access to the same network (WiFi or Ethernet) as the user as could be the case of public WiFi hotspots deployed at shopping centers, airports, hotels, and coffee shops. The attacker may also de-anonymize the user. For this additional stage to succeed, the adversary needs to correlate Radar COVID traffic to other identifiable information from the victim. This could be achieved by associating the connection to a contract with the name of the victim or by associating Radar COVID traffic to other user-generated flows containing identifiers in the clear (e.g., HTTP cookies or other mobile flows sending unique identifiers like the IMEI or the AAID without encryption). The former can be executed, for instance, by the Internet Service Provider or the MNO. The latter can be executed by any on-path adversary, such as the network provider or even the cloud provider that hosts more than one service accessed by the victim. The farther the adversary is either from the victim (the client) or the end-point (the server), the less likely it may be that the adversary has access to re-identification information. The vulnerability has been mitigated with the injection of dummy traffic from the application to the backend. Dummy traffic is generated by all users independently of whether they are COVID-19 positive or not. The issue was fixed in iOS in version 1.0.8 (uniform distribution), 1.1.0 (exponential distribution), Android in version 1.0.7 (uniform distribution), 1.1.0 (exponential distribution), Backend in version 1.1.2-RELEASE. For more information see the referenced GitHub Security Advisory.
CVE-2020-26231||October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. A bypass of CVE-2020-15247 (fixed in 1.0.469 and 1.1.0) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) and v1.1.1.
CVE-2020-26232||Jupyter Server before version 1.0.6 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website.

A link to your jupyter server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.
CVE-2020-26233||Git Credential Manager Core (GCM Core) is a secure Git credential helper built on .NET Core that runs on Windows and macOS. In Git Credential Manager Core before version 2.0.289, when recursively cloning a Git repository on Windows with submodules, Git will first clone the top-level repository and then recursively clone all submodules by starting new Git processes from the top-level working directory. If a malicious git.exe executable is present in the top-level repository then this binary will be started by Git Credential Manager Core when attempting to read configuration, and not git.exe as found on the %PATH%. This only affects GCM Core on Windows, not macOS or Linux-based distributions. GCM Core version 2.0.289 contains the fix for this vulnerability, and is available from the project's GitHub releases page. GCM Core 2.0.289 is also bundled in the latest Git for Windows release; version 2.29.2(3). As a workaround, users should avoid recursively cloning untrusted repositories with the --recurse-submodules option.
CVE-2020-26234||Opencast before versions 8.9 and 7.9 disables HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP client used for a large portion of Opencast's HTTP requests.

CVE-2020-26236||In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only really affects those who comment the code and then take several seconds before finishing the login.
CVE-2020-26237||Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. Highlight.js versions before 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A malicious HTML code block can be crafted that will result in prototype pollution of the base object's prototype during highlighting. If you allow users to insert custom HTML code blocks into your page/app via parsing Markdown code blocks (or similar) and do not filter the language names the user can provide you may be vulnerable. The pollution should just be harmless data but this can cause problems for applications not expecting these properties to exist and can result in strange behavior or application crashes, i.e. a potential DOS vector. If your website or application does not render user provided data it should be unaffected. Versions 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 and newer include fixes for this vulnerability. If you are using version 7 or 8 you are encouraged to upgrade to a newer release.
CVE-2020-26238||Cron-utils is a Java library to parse, validate, migrate crons as well as get human readable descriptions for them. In cron-utils before version 9.1.3, a template Injection vulnerability is present. This enables attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Only projects using the @Cron annotation to validate untrusted Cron expressions are affected. This issue was patched in version 9.1.3.
CVE-2020-26239||Scratch Addons is a WebExtension that supports both Chrome and Firefox. Scratch Addons before version 1.3.2 is vulnerable to DOM-based XSS. If the victim visited a specific website, the More Links addon of the Scratch Addons extension used incorrect regular expression which caused the HTML-escaped values to be unescaped, leading to XSS. Scratch Addons version 1.3.2 fixes the bug. The extension will be automatically updated by the browser. More Links addon can be disabled via the option of the extension.
CVE-2020-2624||Vulnerability in the Enterprise Manager Base Platform product of Oracle Enterprise Manager (component: Connector Framework). Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.5, 13.2.0.0 and 13.3.0.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Enterprise Manager Base Platform. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Enterprise Manager Base Platform. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.0 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).
CVE-2020-26240||Go Ethereum, or "Geth", is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol. An ethash mining DAG generation flaw in Geth before version 1.9.24 could cause miners to erroneously calculate PoW in an upcoming epoch (estimated early January, 2021). This happened on the ETC chain on 2020-11-06. This issue is relevant only for miners, non-mining nodes are unaffected. This issue is fixed as of 1.9.24
CVE-2020-26241||Go Ethereum, or "Geth", is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol. This is a Consensus vulnerability in Geth before version 1.9.17 which can be used to cause a chain-split where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain. Geth's pre-compiled dataCopy (at 0x00...04) contract did a shallow copy on invocation. An attacker could deploy a contract that writes X to an EVM memory region R, then calls 0x00..04 with R as an argument, then overwrites R to Y, and finally invokes the RETURNDATACOPY opcode. When this contract is invoked, a consensus-compliant node would push X on the EVM stack, whereas Geth would push Y. This is fixed in version 1.9.17.
CVE-2020-26242||Go Ethereum, or "Geth", is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In Geth before version 1.9.18, there is a Denial-of-service (crash) during block processing. This is fixed in 1.9.18.
CVE-2020-26243||Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation. In Nanopb before versions 0.4.4 and 0.3.9.7, decoding specifically formed message can leak memory if dynamic allocation is enabled and an oneof field contains a static submessage that contains a dynamic field, and the message being decoded contains the submessage multiple times. This is rare in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed. This is fixed in versions 0.3.9.7 and 0.4.4. The following workarounds are available: 1) Set the option `no_unions` for the oneof field. This will generate fields as separate instead of C union, and avoids triggering the problematic code. 2) Set the type of the submessage field inside oneof to `FT_POINTER`. This way the whole submessage will be dynamically allocated and the problematic code is not executed. 3) Use an arena allocator for nanopb, to make sure all memory can be released afterwards.
CVE-2020-26244||Python oic is a Python OpenID Connect implementation. In Python oic before version 1.2.1, there are several related cryptographic issues affecting client implementations that use the library. The issues are: 1) The IdToken signature algorithm was not checked automatically, but only if the expected algorithm was passed in as a kwarg. 2) JWA `none` algorithm was allowed in all flows. 3) oic.consumer.Consumer.parse_authz returns an unverified IdToken. The verification of the token was left to the discretion of the implementator. 4) iat claim was not checked for sanity (i.e. it could be in the future). These issues are patched in version 1.2.1.
CVE-2020-26245||npm package systeminformation before version 4.30.5 is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution leading to Command Injection. The issue was fixed with a rewrite of shell sanitations to avoid prototyper pollution problems. The issue is fixed in version 4.30.5. If you cannot upgrade, be sure to check or sanitize service parameter strings that are passed to si.inetChecksite().
CVE-2020-26246||Pimcore is an open source digital experience platform. In Pimcore before version 6.8.5 it is possible to modify & create website settings without having the appropriate permissions.
CVE-2020-26247||Nokogiri is a Rubygem providing HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parsers with XPath and CSS selector support. In Nokogiri before version 1.11.0.rc4 there is an XXE vulnerability. XML Schemas parsed by Nokogiri::XML::Schema are trusted by default, allowing external resources to be accessed over the network, potentially enabling XXE or SSRF attacks. This behavior is counter to the security policy followed by Nokogiri maintainers, which is to treat all input as untrusted by default whenever possible. This is fixed in Nokogiri version 1.11.0.rc4.
CVE-2020-26248||In the PrestaShop module "productcomments" before version 4.2.1, an attacker can use a Blind SQL injection to retrieve data or stop the MySQL service. The problem is fixed in 4.2.1 of the module.
CVE-2020-26249||Red Discord Bot Dashboard is an easy-to-use interactive web dashboard to control your Redbot. In Red Discord Bot before version 0.1.7a an RCE exploit has been discovered. This exploit allows Discord users with specially crafted Server names and Usernames/Nicknames to inject code into the webserver front-end code. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. This high severity exploit has been fixed on version 0.1.7a. There are no workarounds, bot owners must upgrade their relevant packages (Dashboard module and Dashboard webserver) in order to patch this issue.
CVE-2020-2625||Vulnerability in the Enterprise Manager Base Platform product of Oracle Enterprise Manager (component: Job System). Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.5, 13.2.0.0 and 13.3.0.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Enterprise Manager Base Platform. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Enterprise Manager Base Platform. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.0 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).
CVE-2020-26250||OAuthenticator is an OAuth login mechanism for JupyterHub. In oauthenticator from version 0.12.0 and before 0.12.2, the deprecated (in jupyterhub 1.2) configuration `Authenticator.whitelist`, which should be transparently mapped to `Authenticator.allowed_users` with a warning, is instead ignored by OAuthenticator classes, resulting in the same behavior as if this configuration has not been set. If this is the only mechanism of authorization restriction (i.e. no group or team restrictions in configuration) then all authenticated users will be allowed. Provider-based restrictions, including deprecated values such as `GitHubOAuthenticator.org_whitelist` are **not** affected. All users of OAuthenticator 0.12.0 and 0.12.1 with JupyterHub 1.2 (JupyterHub Helm chart 0.10.0-0.10.5) who use the `admin.whitelist.users` configuration in the jupyterhub helm chart or the `c.Authenticator.whitelist` configuration directly. Users of other deprecated configuration, e.g. `c.GitHubOAuthenticator.team_whitelist` are **not** affected. If you see a log line like this and expect a specific list of allowed usernames: "[I 2020-11-27 16:51:54.528 JupyterHub app:1717] Not using allowed_users. Any authenticated user will be allowed." you are likely affected. Updating oauthenticator to 0.12.2 is recommended. A workaround is to replace the deprecated `c.Authenticator.whitelist = ...` with `c.Authenticator.allowed_users = ...`. If any users have been authorized during this time who should not have been, they must be deleted via the API or admin interface, per the referenced documentation.
CVE-2020-26251||Open Zaak is a modern, open-source data- and services-layer to enable zaakgericht werken, a Dutch approach to case management. In Open Zaak before version 1.3.3 the Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing policy in Open Zaak is currently wide open - every client is allowed. This allows evil.com to run scripts that perform AJAX calls to known Open Zaak installations, and the browser will not block these. This was intended to only apply to development machines running on localhost/127.0.0.1. Open Zaak 1.3.3 disables CORS by default, while it can be opted-in through environment variables. The vulnerability does not actually seem exploitable because: a) The session cookie has a `Same-Site: Lax` policy which prevents it from being sent along in Cross-Origin requests. b) All pages that give access to (production) data are login-protected c) `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `false` d) CSRF checks probably block the remote origin, since they're not explicitly added to the trusted allowlist.
CVE-2020-26252||OpenMage is a community-driven alternative to Magento CE. In OpenMage before versions 19.4.10 and 20.0.6, there is a vulnerability which enables remote code execution. In affected versions an administrator with permission to update product data to be able to store an executable file on the server and load it via layout xml. The latest OpenMage Versions up from 19.4.10 and 20.0.6 have this issue solved.
CVE-2020-26253||Kirby is a CMS. In Kirby CMS (getkirby/cms) before version 3.3.6, and Kirby Panel before version 2.5.14 there is a vulnerability in which the admin panel may be accessed if hosted on a .dev domain. In order to protect new installations on public servers that don't have an admin account for the Panel yet, we block account registration there by default. This is a security feature, which we implemented years ago in Kirby 2. It helps to avoid that you forget registering your first admin account on a public server. In this case – without our security block – someone else might theoretically be able to find your site, find out it's running on Kirby, find the Panel and then register the account first. It's an unlikely situation, but it's still a certain risk. To be able to register the first Panel account on a public server, you have to enforce the installer via a config setting. This helps to push all users to the best practice of registering your first Panel account on your local machine and upload it together with the rest of the site. This installation block implementation in Kirby versions before 3.3.6 still assumed that .dev domains are local domains, which is no longer true. In the meantime, those domains became publicly available. This means that our installation block is no longer working as expected if you use a .dev domain for your Kirby site. Additionally the local installation check may also fail if your site is behind a reverse proxy. You are only affected if you use a .dev domain or your site is behind a reverse proxy and you have not yet registered your first Panel account on the public server and someone finds your site and tries to login at `yourdomain.dev/panel` before you register your first account. You are not affected if you have already created one or multiple Panel accounts (no matter if on a .dev domain or behind a reverse proxy). The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.3.6. Please upgrade to this or a later version to fix the vulnerability.
CVE-2020-26254||omniauth-apple is the OmniAuth strategy for "Sign In with Apple" (RubyGem omniauth-apple). In omniauth-apple before version 1.0.1 attackers can fake their email address during authentication. This vulnerability impacts applications using the omniauth-apple strategy of OmniAuth and using the info.email field of OmniAuth's Auth Hash Schema for any kind of identification. The value of this field may be set to any value of the attacker's choice including email addresses of other users. Applications not using info.email for identification but are instead using the uid field are not impacted in the same manner. Note, these applications may still be negatively affected if the value of info.email is being used for other purposes. Applications using affected versions of omniauth-apple are advised to upgrade to omniauth-apple version 1.0.1 or later.
CVE-2020-26255||Kirby is a CMS. In Kirby CMS (getkirby/cms) before version 3.4.5, and Kirby Panel before version 2.5.14 , an editor with full access to the Kirby Panel can upload a PHP .phar file and execute it on the server. This vulnerability is critical if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users, as they can gain access to the server with such a Phar file. Visitors without Panel access *cannot* use this attack vector. The problem has been patched in Kirby 2.5.14 and Kirby 3.4.5. Please update to one of these or a later version to fix the vulnerability. Note: Kirby 2 reaches end of life on December 31, 2020. We therefore recommend to upgrade your Kirby 2 sites to Kirby 3. If you cannot upgrade, we still recommend to update to Kirby 2.5.14.
CVE-2020-26256||Fast-csv is an npm package for parsing and formatting CSVs or any other delimited value file in node. In fast-cvs before version 4.3.6 there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability (Regular Expression Denial of Service) when using ignoreEmpty option when parsing. This has been patched in `v4.3.6` You will only be affected by this if you use the `ignoreEmpty` parsing option. If you do use this option it is recommended that you upgrade to the latest version `v4.3.6` This vulnerability was found using a CodeQL query which identified `EMPTY_ROW_REGEXP` regular expression as vulnerable.
CVE-2020-26257||Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. Synapse is a reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix. A malicious or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room by specifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This can lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be correctly sent to other servers over federation. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. The Matrix Synapse reference implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementation is vulnerable to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1. As a workaround homeserver administrators could limit access to the federation API to trusted servers (for example via `federation_domain_whitelist`).
CVE-2020-26258||XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.15, a Server-Side Forgery Request vulnerability can be activated when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist if running Java 15 or higher. No user is affected who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailed in the referenced advisories.
CVE-2020-26259||XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.15, is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion on the local host when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist running Java 15 or higher. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailed in the referenced advisories.
CVE-2020-2626||Vulnerability in the Enterprise Manager Base Platform product of Oracle Enterprise Manager (component: Cloud Control Manager - OMS). Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.5, 13.2.0.0 and 13.3.0.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Enterprise Manager Base Platform. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Enterprise Manager Base Platform. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.0 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).
CVE-2020-26260||BookStack is a platform for storing and organising information and documentation. In BookStack before version 0.30.5, a user with permissions to edit a page could set certain image URL's to manipulate functionality in the exporting system, which would allow them to make server side requests and/or have access to a wider scope of files within the BookStack file storage locations. The issue was addressed in BookStack v0.30.5. As a workaround, page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade.
CVE-2020-26261||jupyterhub-systemdspawner enables JupyterHub to spawn single-user notebook servers using systemd. In jupyterhub-systemdspawner before version 0.15 user API tokens issued to single-user servers are specified in the environment of systemd units. These tokens are incorrectly accessible to all users. In particular, the-littlest-jupyterhub is affected, which uses systemdspawner by default. This is patched in jupyterhub-systemdspawner v0.15
CVE-2020-26262||Coturn is free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Coturn before version 4.5.2 by default does not allow peers to connect and relay packets to loopback addresses in the range of `127.x.x.x`. However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then is able to relay packets to the loopback interface. Additionally, when coturn is listening on IPv6, which is default, the loopback interface can also be reached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address. By using the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will be able to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless `--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since the default configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. The issue patched in version 4.5.2. As a workaround the addresses in the address block `0.0.0.0/8`, `[::1]` and `[::]` should be denied by default unless `--allow-loopback-peers` has been specified.
CVE-2020-26263||tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable. This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.
CVE-2020-26264||Go Ethereum, or "Geth", is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In Geth before version 1.9.25 a denial-of-service vulnerability can make a LES server crash via malicious GetProofsV2 request from a connected LES client. This vulnerability only concerns users explicitly enabling les server; disabling les prevents the exploit. The vulnerability was patched in version 1.9.25.
CVE-2020-26265||Go Ethereum, or "Geth", is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In Geth from version 1.9.4 and before version 1.9.20 a consensus-vulnerability could cause a chain split, where vulnerable versions refuse to accept the canonical chain. The fix was included in the Paragade release version 1.9.20. No individual workaround patches have been made -- all users are recommended to upgrade to a newer version.
CVE-2020-26266||In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases a saved model can trigger use of uninitialized values during code execution. This is caused by having tensor buffers be filled with the default value of the type but forgetting to default initialize the quantized floating point types in Eigen. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.
CVE-2020-26267||In affected versions of TensorFlow the tf.raw_ops.DataFormatVecPermute API does not validate the src_format and dst_format attributes. The code assumes that these two arguments define a permutation of NHWC. This can result in uninitialized memory accesses, read outside of bounds and even crashes. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.
CVE-2020-26268||In affected versions of TensorFlow the tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst operation returns a constant tensor created from a memory mapped file which is assumed immutable. However, if the type of the tensor is not an integral type, the operation crashes the Python interpreter as it tries to write to the memory area. If the file is too small, TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory area has fewer bytes than what is needed for the tensor it creates. However, as soon as there are enough bytes, the above snippet causes a segmentation fault. This is because the allocator used to return the buffer data is not marked as returning an opaque handle since the needed virtual method is not overridden. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.
CVE-2020-26269||In TensorFlow release candidate versions 2.4.0rc*, the general implementation for matching filesystem paths to globbing pattern is vulnerable to an access out of bounds of the array holding the directories. There are multiple invariants and preconditions that are assumed by the parallel implementation of GetMatchingPaths but are not verified by the PRs introducing it (#40861 and #44310). Thus, we are completely rewriting the implementation to fully specify and validate these. This is patched in version 2.4.0. This issue only impacts master branch and the release candidates for TF version 2.4. The final release of the 2.4 release will be patched.
CVE-2020-2627||Vulnerability in the MySQL Server product of Oracle MySQL (component: Server: Parser). Supported versions that are affected are 8.0.18 and prior. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.5 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
CVE-2020-26270||In affected versions of TensorFlow running an LSTM/GRU model where the LSTM/GRU layer receives an input with zero-length results in a CHECK failure when using the CUDA backend. This can result in a query-of-death vulnerability, via denial of service, if users can control the input to the layer. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.
CVE-2020-26271||In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases, loading a saved model can result in accessing uninitialized memory while building the computation graph. The MakeEdge function creates an edge between one output tensor of the src node (given by output_index) and the input slot of the dst node (given by input_index). This is only possible if the types of the tensors on both sides coincide, so the function begins by obtaining the corresponding DataType values and comparing these for equality. However, there is no check that the indices point to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data out of bounds of the corresponding heap allocated arrays. In most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized data access, but if the index points far away from the boundaries of the arrays this can be used to leak addresses from the library. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.
CVE-2020-26272||The Electron framework lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In affected versions of Electron IPC messages sent from the main process to a subframe in the renderer process, through webContents.sendToFrame, event.reply or when using the remote module, can in some cases be delivered to the wrong frame. If your app uses remote, calls webContents.sendToFrame, or calls event.reply in an IPC message handler then it is impacted by this issue. This has been fixed in versions 9.4.0, 10.2.0, 11.1.0, and 12.0.0-beta.9. There are no workarounds for this issue.
CVE-2020-26273||osquery is a SQL powered operating system instrumentation, monitoring, and analytics framework. In osquery before version 4.6.0, by using sqlite's ATTACH verb, someone with administrative access to osquery can cause reads and writes to arbitrary sqlite databases on disk. This _does_ allow arbitrary files to be created, but they will be sqlite databases. It does not appear to allow existing non-sqlite files to be overwritten. This has been patched in osquery 4.6.0. There are several mitigating factors and possible workarounds. In some deployments, the people with access to these interfaces may be considered administrators. In some deployments, configuration is managed by a central tool. This tool can filter for the `ATTACH` keyword. osquery can be run as non-root user. Because this also limits the desired access levels, this requires deployment specific testing and configuration.
CVE-2020-26274||In systeminformation (npm package) before version 4.31.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. The problem was fixed in version 4.31.1 with a shell string sanitation fix.
CVE-2020-26275||The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter notebook, JupyterLab, and Voila. In Jupyter Server before version 1.1.1, an open redirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter server to redirect the browser to a different malicious website. All jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8. This is fixed in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix: "jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/".
CVE-2020-26276||Fleet is an open source osquery manager. In Fleet before version 3.5.1, due to issues in Go's standard library XML parsing, a valid SAML response may be mutated by an attacker to modify the trusted document. This can result in allowing unverified logins from a SAML IdP. Users that configure Fleet with SSO login may be vulnerable to this issue. This issue is patched in 3.5.1. The fix was made using https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator If upgrade to 3.5.1 is not possible, users should disable SSO authentication in Fleet.
CVE-2020-26277||DBdeployer is a tool that deploys MySQL database servers easily. In DBdeployer before version 1.58.2, users unpacking a tarball may use a maliciously packaged tarball that contains symlinks to files external to the target. In such scenario, an attacker could induce dbdeployer to write into a system file, thus altering the computer defenses. For the attack to succeed, the following factors need to contribute: 1) The user is logged in as root. While dbdeployer is usable as root, it was designed to run as unprivileged user. 2) The user has taken a tarball from a non secure source, without testing the checksum. When the tarball is retrieved through dbdeployer, the checksum is compared before attempting to unpack. This has been fixed in version 1.58.2.
CVE-2020-26278||Weave Net is open source software which creates a virtual network that connects Docker containers across multiple hosts and enables their automatic discovery. Weave Net before version 2.8.0 has a vulnerability in which can allow an attacker to take over any host in the cluster. Weave Net is supplied with a manifest that runs pods on every node in a Kubernetes cluster, which are responsible for managing network connections for all other pods in the cluster. This requires a lot of power over the host, and the manifest sets `privileged: true`, which gives it that power. It also set `hostPID: true`, which gave it the ability to access all other processes on the host, and write anywhere in the root filesystem of the host. This setting was not necessary, and is being removed. You are only vulnerable if you have an additional vulnerability (e.g. a bug in Kubernetes) or misconfiguration that allows an attacker to run code inside the Weave Net pod, No such bug is known at the time of release, and there are no known instances of this being exploited. Weave Net 2.8.0 removes the hostPID setting and moves CNI plugin install to an init container. Users who do not update to 2.8.0 can edit the hostPID line in their existing DaemonSet manifest to say false instead of true, arrange some other way to install CNI plugins (e.g. Ansible) and remove those mounts from the DaemonSet manifest.
CVE-2020-26279||go-ipfs is an open-source golang implementation of IPFS which is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. In go-ipfs before version 0.8.0-rc1, it is possible for path traversal to occur with DAGs containing relative paths during retrieval. This can cause files to be overwritten, or written to incorrect output directories. The issue can only occur when a get is done on an affected DAG. This is fixed in version 0.8.0-rc1.

Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Enterprise Manager Base Platform. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Enterprise Manager Base Platform accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Enterprise Manager Base Platform. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.0 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).
CVE-2020-26280||OpenSlides is a free, Web-based presentation and assembly system for managing and projecting agenda, motions, and elections of assemblies. OpenSlides version 3.2, due to unsufficient user input validation and escaping, it is vulnerable to persistant cross-site scripting (XSS). In the web applications users can enter rich text in various places, e.g. for personal notes or in motions. These fields can be used to store arbitrary JavaScript Code that will be executed when other users read the respective text. An attacker could utilize this vulnerability be used to manipulate votes of other users, hijack the moderators session or simply disturb the meeting. The vulnerability was introduced with 6eae497abeab234418dfbd9d299e831eff86ed45 on 16.04.2020, which is first included in the 3.2 release. It has been patched in version 3.3 ( in commit f3809fc8a97ee305d721662a75f788f9e9d21938, merged in master on 20.11.2020).
CVE-2020-26281||async-h1 is an asynchronous HTTP/1.1 parser for Rust (crates.io). There is a request smuggling vulnerability in async-h1 before version 2.3.0. This vulnerability affects any webserver that uses async-h1 behind a reverse proxy, including all such Tide applications. If the server does not read the body of a request which is longer than some buffer length, async-h1 will attempt to read a subsequent request from the body content starting at that offset into the body. One way to exploit this vulnerability would be for an adversary to craft a request such that the body contains a request that would not be noticed by a reverse proxy, allowing it to forge forwarded/x-forwarded headers. If an application trusted the authenticity of these headers, it could be misled by the smuggled request. Another potential concern with this vulnerability is that if a reverse proxy is sending multiple http clients' requests along the same keep-alive connection, it would be possible for the smuggled request to specify a long content and capture another user's request in its body. This content could be captured in a post request to an endpoint that allows the content to be subsequently retrieved by the adversary. This has been addressed in async-h1 2.3.0 and previous versions have been yanked.
CVE-2020-26282||BrowserUp Proxy allows you to manipulate HTTP requests and responses, capture HTTP content, and export performance data as a HAR file. BrowserUp Proxy works well as a standalone proxy server, but it is especially useful when embedded in Selenium tests. A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in BrowserUp Proxy enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. This has been patched in version 2.1.2.
CVE-2020-26283||go-ipfs is an open-source golang implementation of IPFS which is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. In go-ipfs before version 0.8.0, control characters are not escaped from console output. This can result in hiding input from the user which could result in the user taking an unknown, malicious action. This is fixed in version 0.8.0.
CVE-2020-26284||Hugo is a fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built in Go. Hugo depends on Go's `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents if these binaries are found in the system `%PATH%` on Windows. In Hugo before version 0.79.1, if a malicious file with the same name (`exe` or `bat`) is found in the current working directory at the time of running `hugo`, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one. Windows users who run `hugo` inside untrusted Hugo sites are affected. Users should upgrade to Hugo v0.79.1. Other than avoiding untrusted Hugo sites, there is no workaround.
CVE-2020-26285||OpenMage is a community-driven alternative to Magento CE. In OpenMage before versions 19.4.10 and 20.0.5, there is a vulnerability which enables remote code execution.

The latest OpenMage Versions up from 19.4.9 and 20.0.5 have this Issue solved
CVE-2020-26286||HedgeDoc is a collaborative platform for writing and sharing markdown. In HedgeDoc before version 1.7.1 an unauthenticated attacker can upload arbitrary files to the upload storage backend including HTML, JS and PHP files. The problem is patched in HedgeDoc 1.7.1. You should however verify that your uploaded file storage only contains files that are allowed, as uploaded files might still be served. As workaround it's possible to block the `/uploadimage` endpoint on your instance using your reverse proxy. And/or restrict MIME-types and file names served from your upload file storage.
CVE-2020-26287||HedgeDoc is a collaborative platform for writing and sharing markdown. In HedgeDoc before version 1.7.1 an attacker can inject arbitrary `script` tags in HedgeDoc notes using mermaid diagrams. Our content security policy prevents loading scripts from most locations, but `www.google-analytics.com` is allowed. Using Google Tag Manger it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript and execute it on page load. Depending on the configuration of the instance, the attacker may not need authentication to create or edit notes. The problem is patched in HedgeDoc 1.7.1. As a workaround one can disallow `www.google-analytics.com` in the `Content-Security-Policy` header. Note that other ways to leverage the `script` tag injection might exist.
CVE-2020-26288||Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. It is an npm package "parse-server". In Parse Server before version 4.5.0, user passwords involved in LDAP authentication are stored in cleartext.

The vulnerabilities have been addressed in version 2.27.0 by using the xml-roundtrip-validator from Mattermost (see related references).
CVE-2020-26291||URI.js is a javascript URL mutation library (npm package urijs). In URI.js before version 1.19.4, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\`) character followed by an at (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect. Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior. For example the URL `https://expected-example.com\@observed-example.com` will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version. Patched versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the WHATWG URL specification, including web browsers and Node's built-in URL class. Version 1.19.4 is patched against all known payload variants. Version 1.19.3 has a partial patch but is still vulnerable to a payload variant.]

CVE-2020-26890||Matrix Synapse before 1.20.0 erroneously permits non-standard NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity JSON values in fields of m.room.member events, allowing remote attackers to execute a denial of service attack against the federation and common Matrix clients. If such a malformed event is accepted into the room's state, the impact is long-lasting and is not fixed by an upgrade to a newer version, requiring the event to be manually redacted instead. Since events are replicated to servers of other room members, the impact is not constrained to the server of the event sender.
CVE-2020-26891||AuthRestServlet in Matrix Synapse before 1.21.0 is vulnerable to XSS due to unsafe interpolation of the session GET parameter. This allows a remote attacker to execute an XSS attack on the domain Synapse is hosted on, by supplying the victim user with a malicious URL to the /_matrix/client/r0/auth/*/fallback/web or /_matrix/client/unstable/auth/*/fallback/web Synapse endpoints.
CVE-2020-26892||The JWT library in NATS nats-server before 2.1.9 has Incorrect Access Control because of how expired credentials are handled.

CVE-2020-26894||LiveCode v9.6.1 on Windows allows local, low-privileged users to gain privileges by creating a malicious "cmd.exe" in the folder of the vulnerable LiveCode application. If the application is using LiveCode's "shell()" function, it will attempt to search for "cmd.exe" in the folder of the current application and run the malicious "cmd.exe".
CVE-2020-26895||Prior to 0.10.0-beta, LND (Lightning Network Daemon) would have accepted a counterparty high-S signature and broadcast tx-relay invalid local commitment/HTLC transactions. This can be exploited by any peer with an open channel regardless of the victim situation (e.g., routing node, payment-receiver, or payment-sender). The impact is a loss of funds in certain situations.
CVE-2020-26896||Prior to 0.11.0-beta, LND (Lightning Network Daemon) had a vulnerability in its invoice database. While claiming on-chain a received HTLC output, it didn't verify that the corresponding outgoing off-chain HTLC was already settled before releasing the preimage. In the case of a hash-and-amount collision with an invoice, the preimage for an expected payment was instead released. A malicious peer could have deliberately intercepted an HTLC intended for the victim node, probed the preimage through a colluding relayed HTLC, and stolen the intercepted HTLC. The impact is a loss of funds in certain situations, and a weakening of the victim's receiver privacy.

CVE-2020-27483||Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Array index error. The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter trusts the offset provided for the stack value duplication instruction, DUP. The offset is unchecked and memory prior to the start of the execution stack can be read and treated as a TVM object. A successful exploit could use the vulnerability to leak runtime information such as the heap handle or pointer for a number of TVM context variables. Some reachable values may be controlled enough to forge a TVM object on the stack, leading to possible remote code execution.

CVE-2020-27485||Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Array index error. The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter fails to check the index provided when accessing the local variable in the LGETV and LPUTV instructions. This provides the ability to both read and write memory outside the bounds of the TVM context allocation. It can be leveraged to construct a use-after-free scenario, leading to a constrained read/write primitive across the entire MAX32630 address space. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application execution environment.
CVE-2020-27486||Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Buffer Overflow. The component is: ConnectIQ TVM.

The ConnectIQ program interpreter trusts the string length provided in the data section of the PRG file. It allocates memory for the string immediately, and then copies the string into the TVM object by using a function similar to strcpy. This copy can exceed the length of the allocated string data and overwrite heap data. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application execution environment.
