CVE-2016-1550||An exploitable vulnerability exists in the message authentication functionality of libntp in ntp 4.2.8p4 and NTPSec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92. An attacker can send a series of crafted messages to attempt to recover the message digest key.
CVE-2016-1551||ntpd in NTP 4.2.8p3 and NTPsec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 relies on the underlying operating system to protect it from requests that impersonate reference clocks. Because reference clocks are treated like other peers and stored in the same structure, any packet with a source ip address of a reference clock (127.127.1.1 for example) that reaches the receive() function will match that reference clock's peer record and will be treated as a trusted peer. Any system that lacks the typical martian packet filtering which would block these packets is in danger of having its time controlled by an attacker.

CVE-2016-2122||** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was in a CNA pool that was not assigned to any issues during 2016. Notes: none.
CVE-2016-2123||A flaw was found in samba versions 4.0.0 to 4.5.2. The Samba routine ndr_pull_dnsp_name contains an integer wrap problem, leading to an attacker-controlled memory overwrite. ndr_pull_dnsp_name parses data from the Samba Active Directory ldb database. Any user who can write to the dnsRecord attribute over LDAP can trigger this memory corruption. By default, all authenticated LDAP users can write to the dnsRecord attribute on new DNS objects. This makes the defect a remote privilege escalation.
CVE-2016-2124||A flaw was found in the way samba implemented SMB1 authentication. An attacker could use this flaw to retrieve the plaintext password sent over the wire even if Kerberos authentication was required.
CVE-2016-2125||It was found that Samba before versions 4.5.3, 4.4.8, 4.3.13 always requested forwardable tickets when using Kerberos authentication. A service to which Samba authenticated using Kerberos could subsequently use the ticket to impersonate Samba to other services or domain users.
CVE-2016-2126||Samba version 4.0.0 up to 4.5.2 is vulnerable to privilege elevation due to incorrect handling of the PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) checksum. A remote, authenticated, attacker can cause the winbindd process to crash using a legitimate Kerberos ticket. A local service with access to the winbindd privileged pipe can cause winbindd to cache elevated access permissions.

CVE-2016-3173||An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX AppSuite before 7.8.0-rev27. The aria-label parameter of tiles at the Portal can be used to inject script code. Those labels use the name of the file (e.g. an image) which gets displayed at the portal application. Using script code at the file name leads to script execution. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).

CVE-2016-4025||Avast Internet Security v11.x.x, Pro Antivirus v11.x.x, Premier v11.x.x, Free Antivirus v11.x.x, Business Security v11.x.x, Endpoint Protection v8.x.x, Endpoint Protection Plus v8.x.x, Endpoint Protection Suite v8.x.x, Endpoint Protection Suite Plus v8.x.x, File Server Security v8.x.x, and Email Server Security v8.x.x allow attackers to bypass the DeepScreen feature via a DeviceIoControl call.
CVE-2016-4026||An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev11. The content sanitizer component has an issue with filtering malicious content in case invalid HTML code is provided. In such cases the filter will output a unsanitized representation of the content. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). Attackers can use this issue for filter evasion to inject script code later on.
CVE-2016-4027||An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev10. App Suite frontend offers to control whether a user wants to store cookies that exceed the session duration. This functionality is useful when logging in from clients with reduced privileges or shared environments. However the setting was incorrectly recognized and cookies were stored regardless of this setting when the login was performed using a non-interactive login method. In case the setting was enforced by middleware configuration or the user went through the interactive login page, the workflow was correct. Cookies with authentication information may become available to other users on shared environments. In case the user did not properly log out from the session, third parties with access to the same client can access a user's account.
CVE-2016-4028||An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX Guard before 2.4.0-rev8. OX Guard uses an authentication token to identify and transfer guest users' credentials.  The OX Guard API acts as a padding oracle by responding with different error codes depending on whether the provided token matches the encryption padding.  In combination with AES-CBC, this allows attackers to guess the correct padding.  Attackers may run brute-forcing attacks on the content of the guest authentication token and discover user credentials.  For a practical attack vector, the guest users needs to have logged in, the content of the guest user's "OxReaderID" cookie and the value of the "auth" parameter needs to be known to the attacker.
CVE-2016-4029||WordPress before 4.5 does not consider octal and hexadecimal IP address formats when determining an intranet address, which allows remote attackers to bypass an intended SSRF protection mechanism via a crafted address.

CVE-2016-4032||Samsung SM-G920F build G920FXXU2COH2 (Galaxy S6), SM-N9005 build N9005XXUGBOK6 (Galaxy Note 3), GT-I9192 build I9192XXUBNB1 (Galaxy S4 mini), GT-I9195 build I9195XXUCOL1 (Galaxy S4 mini LTE), and GT-I9505 build I9505XXUHOJ2 (Galaxy S4) devices do not block AT+USBDEBUG and AT+WIFIVALUE, which allows attackers to modify Android settings by leveraging AT access, aka SVE-2016-5301.
CVE-2016-4036||The quagga package before 0.99.23-2.6.1 in openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP 1 uses weak permissions for /etc/quagga, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading files in the directory.
CVE-2016-4037||The ehci_advance_state function in hw/usb/hcd-ehci.c in QEMU allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a circular split isochronous transfer descriptor (siTD) list, a related issue to CVE-2015-8558.

CVE-2016-4045||An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev11. Script code can be embedded to RSS feeds using a URL notation. In case a user clicks the corresponding link at the RSS reader of App Suite, code gets executed at the context of the user. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). The attacker needs to reside within the same context to make this attack work.
CVE-2016-4046||An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev11. The API to configure external mail accounts can be abused to map and access network components within the trust boundary of the operator. Users can inject arbitrary hosts and ports to API calls. Depending on the response type, content and latency, information about existence of hosts and services can be gathered. Attackers can get internal configuration information about the infrastructure of an operator to prepare subsequent attacks.
CVE-2016-4047||An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev8. References to external Open XML document type definitions (.dtd resources) can be placed within .docx and .xslx files. Those resources were requested when parsing certain parts of the generated document. As a result an attacker can track access to a manipulated document. Usage of a document may get tracked and information about internal infrastructure may get exposed.
CVE-2016-4048||An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev11. Custom messages can be shown at the login screen to notify external users about issues with sharing links.
