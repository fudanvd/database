CVE-2010-0292||The read_from_cmd_socket function in cmdmon.c in chronyd in Chrony before 1.23.1, and 1.24-pre1, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) by sending a spoofed cmdmon packet that triggers a continuous exchange of NOHOSTACCESS messages between two daemons, a related issue to CVE-2009-3563.
CVE-2010-0293||The client logging functionality in chronyd in Chrony before 1.23.1 does not restrict the amount of memory used for storage of client information, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via spoofed (1) NTP or (2) cmdmon packets.
CVE-2010-0294||chronyd in Chrony before 1.23.1, and possibly 1.24-pre1, generates a syslog message for each unauthorized cmdmon packet, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) via a large number of invalid packets.
CVE-2010-0295||lighttpd before 1.4.26, and 1.5.x, allocates a buffer for each read operation that occurs for a request, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by breaking a request into small pieces that are sent at a slow rate.
CVE-2010-0296||The encode_name macro in misc/mntent_r.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.11.1 and earlier, as used by ncpmount and mount.cifs, does not properly handle newline characters in mountpoint names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mtab corruption), or possibly modify mount options and gain privileges, via a crafted mount request.
CVE-2010-0297||Buffer overflow in the usb_host_handle_control function in the USB passthrough handling implementation in usb-linux.c in QEMU before 0.11.1 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash or hang) or possibly execute arbitrary code on the host OS via a crafted USB packet.
