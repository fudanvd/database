CVE-2017-8850||An issue was discovered on OnePlus One, X, 2, 3, and 3T devices. Due to a lenient updater-script in the OnePlus OTA images, and the fact that both ROMs use the same OTA verification keys, attackers can install HydrogenOS over OxygenOS and vice versa, even on locked bootloaders, which allows for exploitation of vulnerabilities patched on one image but not on the other, in addition to expansion of the attack surface. This vulnerability can be exploited by Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attackers targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, physical attackers can reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA (on OnePlus 3/3T 'Secure Start-up' must be off).
CVE-2017-8851||An issue was discovered on OnePlus One and X devices. Due to a lenient updater-script on the OnePlus One and X OTA images, the fact that both products use the same OTA verification keys, and the fact that both products share the same 'ro.build.product' system property, attackers can install OTAs of one product over the other, even on locked bootloaders. That could theoretically allow for exploitation of vulnerabilities patched on one image but not on the other, in addition to expansion of the attack surface. Moreover, the vulnerability may result in having the device unusable until a Factory Reset is performed. This vulnerability can be exploited by Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attackers targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370).

CVE-2017-9047||A buffer overflow was discovered in libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. The variable len is assigned strlen(buf). If the content->type is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT, then (i) the content->prefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits) whereupon (ii) content->name is written to the buffer. However, the check for whether the content->name actually fits also uses 'len' rather than the updated buffer length strlen(buf). This allows us to write about "size" many bytes beyond the allocated memory. This vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.
CVE-2017-9048||libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. At the end of the routine, the function may strcat two more characters without checking whether the current strlen(buf) + 2 < size. This vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.

CVE-2017-9103||An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. pap_mailbox822 does not properly check st from adns__findlabel_next. Without this, an uninitialised stack value can be used as the first label length. Depending on the circumstances, an attacker might be able to trick adns into crashing the calling program, leaking aspects of the contents of some of its memory, causing it to allocate lots of memory, or perhaps overrunning a buffer. This is only possible with applications which make non-raw queries for SOA or RP records.
CVE-2017-9104||An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It hangs, eating CPU, if a compression pointer loop is encountered.
CVE-2017-9105||An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It corrupts a pointer when a nameserver speaks first because of a wrong number of pointer dereferences. This bug may well be exploitable as a remote code execution.
CVE-2017-9106||An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adns_rr_info mishandles a bogus *datap. The general pattern for formatting integers is to sprintf into a fixed-size buffer. This is correct if the input is in the right range; if it isn't, the buffer may be overrun (depending on the sizes of the types on the current platform). Of course the inputs ought to be right. And there are pointers in there too, so perhaps one could say that the caller ought to check these things. It may be better to require the caller to make the pointer structure right, but to have the code here be defensive about (and tolerate with an error but without crashing) out-of-range integer values. So: it should defend each of these integer conversion sites with a check for the actual permitted range, and return adns_s_invaliddata if not. The lack of this check causes the SOA sign extension bug to be a serious security problem: the sign extended SOA value is out of range, and overruns the buffer when reconverted. This is related to sign extending SOA 32-bit integer fields, and use of a signed data type.
CVE-2017-9107||An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It overruns reading a buffer if a domain ends with backslash. If the query domain ended with \, and adns_qf_quoteok_query was specified, qdparselabel would read additional bytes from the buffer and try to treat them as the escape sequence. It would depart the input buffer and start processing many bytes of arbitrary heap data as if it were the query domain. Eventually it would run out of input or find some other kind of error, and declare the query domain invalid. But before then it might outrun available memory and crash. In principle this could be a denial of service attack.
CVE-2017-9108||An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adnshost mishandles a missing final newline on a stdin read. It is wrong to increment used as well as setting r, since used is incremented according to r, later. Rather one should be doing what read() would have done. Without this fix, adnshost may read and process one byte beyond the buffer, perhaps crashing or perhaps somehow leaking the value of that byte.
CVE-2017-9109||An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It fails to ignore apparent answers before the first RR that was found the first time. when this is fixed, the second answer scan finds the same RRs at the first. Otherwise, adns can be confused by interleaving answers for the CNAME target, with the CNAME itself. In that case the answer data structure (on the heap) can be overrun. With this fixed, it prefers to look only at the answer RRs which come after the CNAME, which is at least arguably correct.
CVE-2017-9110||In OpenEXR 2.2.0, an invalid read of size 2 in the hufDecode function in ImfHuf.cpp could cause the application to crash.

CVE-2017-9131||An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. By connecting to the Mosquitto broker on an access point and one of its clients, an attacker can gather enough information to craft a command that reboots the client remotely when sent to the client's Mosquitto broker, aka "unauthenticated remote command execution." This command can be re-sent endlessly to act as a DoS attack on the client.
CVE-2017-9132||A hard-coded credentials issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3, Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3, and Mimosa Access Points before 2.2.3. These devices run Mosquitto, a lightweight message broker, to send information between devices. By using the vendor's hard-coded credentials to connect to the broker on any device (whether it be an AP, Client, or Backhaul model), an attacker can view all the messages being sent between the devices. If an attacker connects to an AP, the AP will leak information about any clients connected to it, including the serial numbers, which can be used to remotely factory reset the clients via a page in their web interface.
CVE-2017-9133||An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. In the device's web interface, after logging in, there is a page that allows you to ping other hosts from the device and view the results. The user is allowed to specify which host to ping, but this variable is not sanitized server-side, which allows an attacker to pass a specially crafted string to execute shell commands as the root user.
CVE-2017-9134||An information-leakage issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3. There is a page in the web interface that will show you the device's serial number, regardless of whether or not you have logged in. This information-leakage issue is relevant because there is another page (accessible without any authentication) that allows you to remotely factory reset the device simply by entering the serial number.
CVE-2017-9135||An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.4 and Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.4. On the backend of the device's web interface, there are some diagnostic tests available that are not displayed on the webpage; these are only accessible by crafting a POST request with a program like cURL. There is one test accessible via cURL that does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to execute shell commands as the root user.
CVE-2017-9136||An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3. In the device's web interface, there is a page that allows an attacker to use an unsanitized GET parameter to download files from the device as the root user. The attacker can download any file from the device's filesystem. This can be used to view unsalted, MD5-hashed administrator passwords, which can then be cracked, giving the attacker full admin access to the device's web interface. This vulnerability can also be used to view the plaintext pre-shared key (PSK) for encrypted wireless connections, or to view the device's serial number (which allows an attacker to factory reset the device).
CVE-2017-9137||Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 wireless radios through 7.2.0 have a default password of mateidu for the mateidu account (a hidden user account established by the vendor). This account can be accessed via both the web interface and SSH. In the web interface, this simply grants an attacker read-only access to the device's settings. However, when using SSH, this gives an attacker access to a Linux shell. NOTE: the vendor has commented "The mateidu user is a known user, which is mentioned in the FibeAir IP-10 User Guide. Customers are instructed to change the mateidu user password. Changing the user password fully solves the vulnerability."
CVE-2017-9138||There is a debug-interface vulnerability on some Tenda routers (FH1202/F1202/F1200: versions before 1.2.0.20).

CVE-2017-9380||OpenEMR 5.0.0 and prior allows low-privilege users to upload files of dangerous types which can result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.
CVE-2017-9381||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a user with the capability of installing or deleting apps on the device using the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site request forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who navigates to an attacker controlled page to install or delete an application on the device. Note: The cross-site request forgery is a systemic issue across all other functionalities of the device.
CVE-2017-9382||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url "/port_3480". It seems that the UPnP services provide "file" as one of the service actions for a normal user to read a file that is stored under the /etc/cmh-lu folder. It retrieves the value from the "parameters" query string variable and then passes it to an internal function "FileUtils::ReadFileIntoBuffer" which is a library function that does not perform any sanitization on the value submitted and this allows an attacker to use directory traversal characters "../" and read files from other folders within the device.
CVE-2017-9383||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url "/port_3480". It seems that the UPnP services provide "wget" as one of the service actions for a normal user to connect the device to an external website. It retrieves the parameter "URL" from the query string and then passes it to an internal function that uses the curl module on the device to retrieve the contents of the website.
CVE-2017-9384||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a web user interface that allows a user to manage the device. As a part of the functionality the device firmware file contains a file known as relay.sh which allows the device to create relay ports and connect the device to Vera servers. This is primarily used as a method of communication between the device and Vera servers so the devices can be communicated with even when the user is not at home. One of the parameters retrieved by this specific script is "remote_host". This parameter is not sanitized by the script correctly and is passed in a call to "eval" to execute another script where remote_host is concatenated to be passed a parameter to the second script. This allows an attacker to escape from the executed command and then execute any commands of his/her choice.
CVE-2017-9385||An issue was discovered on Vera Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device has an additional OpenWRT interface in addition to the standard web interface which allows the highest privileges a user can obtain on the device. This web interface uses root as the username and the password in the /etc/cmh/cmh.conf file which can be extracted by an attacker using a directory traversal attack, and then log in to the device with the highest privileges.
CVE-2017-9386||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a script file called "get_file.sh" which allows a user to retrieve any file stored in the "cmh-ext" folder on the device. However, the "filename" parameter is not validated correctly and this allows an attacker to directory traverse outside the /cmh-ext folder and read any file on the device. It is necessary to create the folder "cmh-ext" on the device which can be executed by an attacker first in an unauthenticated fashion and then execute a directory traversal attack.
CVE-2017-9387||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a shell script called relay.sh which is used for creating new SSH relays for the device so that the device connects to Vera servers. All the parameters passed in this specific script are logged to a log file called log.relay in the /tmp folder. The user can also read all the log files from the device using a script called log.sh. However, when the script loads the log files it displays them with content-type text/html and passes all the logs through the ansi2html binary which converts all the character text including HTML meta-characters correctly to be displayed in the browser. This allows an attacker to use the log files as a storing mechanism for the XSS payload and thus whenever a user navigates to that log.sh script, it enables the XSS payload and allows an attacker to execute his malicious payload on the user's browser.
CVE-2017-9388||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a web user interface that allows a user to manage the device. As a part of the functionality the device firmware file contains a file known as proxy.sh which allows the device to proxy a specific request to and from from another website. This is primarily used as a method of communication between the device and Vera website when the user is logged in to the https://home.getvera.com and allows the device to communicate between the device and website. One of the parameters retrieved by this specific script is "url". This parameter is not sanitized by the script correctly and is passed in a call to "eval" to execute "curl" functionality. This allows an attacker to escape from the executed command and then execute any commands of his/her choice.
CVE-2017-9389||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a web user interface that allows a user to manage the device. As a part of the functionality the device allows a user to install applications written in the Lua programming language. Also the interface allows any user to write his/her application in the Lua language. However, this functionality is not protected by authentication and this allows an attacker to run arbitrary Lua code on the device. The POST request is forwarded to LuaUPNP daemon on the device. This binary handles the received Lua code in the function "LU::JobHandler_LuaUPnP::RunLua(LU::JobHandler_LuaUPnP *__hidden this, LU::UPnPActionWrapper *)". The value in the "code" parameter is then passed to the function "LU::LuaInterface::RunCode(char const*)" which actually loads the Lua engine and runs the code.
CVE-2017-9390||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a shell script called connect.sh which is supposed to return a specific cookie for the user when the user is authenticated to https://home.getvera.com. One of the parameters retrieved by this script is "RedirectURL". However, the application lacks strict input validation of this parameter and this allows an attacker to execute the client-side code on this application.
CVE-2017-9391||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url "/port_3480". It seems that the UPnP services provide "request_image" as one of the service actions for a normal user to retrieve an image from a camera that is controlled by the controller. It seems that the "URL" parameter passed in the query string is not sanitized and is stored on the stack which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer. The function "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::REQ_Image" is activated when the lu_request_image is passed as the "id" parameter in query string. This function then calls "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::GetUrlFromArguments" and passes a "pointer" to the function where it will be allowed to store the value from the URL parameter. This pointer is passed as the second parameter $a2 to the function "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::GetUrlFromArguments". However, neither the callee or the caller in this case performs a simple length check and as a result an attacker who is able to send more than 1336 characters can easily overflow the values stored on the stack including the $RA value and thus execute code on the device.
CVE-2017-9392||An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url "/port_3480". It seems that the UPnP services provide "request_image" as one of the service actions for a normal user to retrieve an image from a camera that is controlled by the controller. It seems that the "res" (resolution) parameter passed in the query string is not sanitized and is stored on the stack which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer. The function "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::REQ_Image" is activated when the lu_request_image is passed as the "id" parameter in the query string. This function then calls "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::GetUrlFromArguments". This function retrieves all the parameters passed in the query string including "res" and then uses the value passed in it to fill up buffer using the sprintf function. However, the function in this case lacks a simple length check and as a result an attacker who is able to send more than 184 characters can easily overflow the values stored on the stack including the $RA value and thus execute code on the device.

CVE-2017-9792||In Apache Impala (incubating) before 2.10.0, a malicious user with "ALTER" permissions on an Impala table can access any other Kudu table data by altering the table properties to make it "external" and then changing the underlying table mapping to point to other Kudu tables. This violates and works around the authorization requirement that creating a Kudu external table via Impala requires an "ALL" privilege at the server scope. This privilege requirement for "CREATE" commands is enforced to precisely avoid this scenario where a malicious user can change the underlying Kudu table mapping. The fix is to enforce the same privilege requirement for "ALTER" commands that would make existing non-external Kudu tables external.

CVE-2017-9798||Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.

CVE-2017-9803||Apache Solr's Kerberos plugin can be configured to use delegation tokens, which allows an application to reuse the authentication of an end-user or another application. There are two issues with this functionality (when using SecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g. SaslZkACLProvider). Firstly, access to the security configuration can be leaked to users other than the solr super user. Secondly, malicious users can exploit this leaked configuration for privilege escalation to further expose/modify private data and/or disrupt operations in the Solr cluster. The vulnerability is fixed from Apache Solr 6.6.1 onwards.

CVE-2017-9851||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. By sending nonsense data or setting up a TELNET session to the database port of Sunny Explorer, the application can be crashed. NOTE: the vendor reports that the maximum possible damage is a communication failure. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9852||** DISPUTED ** An Incorrect Password Management issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. Default passwords exist that are rarely changed. User passwords will almost always be default. Installer passwords are expected to be default or similar across installations installed by the same company (but are sometimes changed). Hidden user accounts have (at least in some cases, though more research is required to test this for all hidden user accounts) a fixed password for all devices; it can never be changed by a user. Other vulnerabilities exist that allow an attacker to get the passwords of these hidden user accounts. NOTE: the vendor reports that it has no influence on the allocation of passwords, and that global hardcoded master passwords do not exist. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9853||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. All inverters have a very weak password policy for the user and installer password. No complexity requirements or length requirements are set. Also, strong passwords are impossible due to a maximum of 12 characters and a limited set of characters. NOTE: the vendor reports that the 12-character limit provides "a very high security standard." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9854||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. By sniffing for specific packets on the localhost, plaintext passwords can be obtained as they are typed into Sunny Explorer by the user. These passwords can then be used to compromise the overall device. NOTE: the vendor reports that exploitation likelihood is low because these packets are usually sent only once during installation. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9855||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. A secondary authentication system is available for Installers called the Grid Guard system. This system uses predictable codes, and a single Grid Guard code can be used on any SMA inverter. Any such code, when combined with the installer account, allows changing very sensitive parameters. NOTE: the vendor reports that Grid Guard is not an authentication feature; it is only a tracing feature. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9856||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. Sniffed passwords from SMAdata2+ communication can be decrypted very easily. The passwords are "encrypted" using a very simple encryption algorithm. This enables an attacker to find the plaintext passwords and authenticate to the device. NOTE: the vendor reports that only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9857||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SMAdata2+ communication protocol does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to man in the middle, packet injection, and replay attacks. Any setting change, authentication packet, scouting packet, etc. can be replayed, injected, or used for a man in the middle session. All functionalities available in Sunny Explorer can effectively be done from anywhere within the network as long as an attacker gets the packet setup correctly. This includes the authentication process for all (including hidden) access levels and the changing of settings in accordance with the gained access rights. Furthermore, because the SMAdata2+ communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9858||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. By sending crafted packets to an inverter and observing the response, active and inactive user accounts can be determined. This aids in further attacks (such as a brute force attack) as one now knows exactly which users exist and which do not. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this "is not a security gap per se." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9859||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The inverters make use of a weak hashing algorithm to encrypt the password for REGISTER requests. This hashing algorithm can be cracked relatively easily. An attacker will likely be able to crack the password using offline crackers. This cracked password can then be used to register at the SMA servers. NOTE: the vendor's position is that "we consider the probability of the success of such manipulation to be extremely low." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9860||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. An attacker can use Sunny Explorer or the SMAdata2+ network protocol to update the device firmware without ever having to authenticate. If an attacker is able to create a custom firmware version that is accepted by the inverter, the inverter is compromised completely. This allows the attacker to do nearly anything: for example, giving access to the local OS, creating a botnet, using the inverters as a stepping stone into companies, etc. NOTE: the vendor reports that this attack has always been blocked by "a final integrity and compatibility check." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9861||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SIP implementation does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to replay attacks, packet injection attacks, and man in the middle attacks. An attacker is able to successfully use SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere within the LAN. An attacker may use this to crash the device, stop it from communicating with the SMA servers, exploit known SIP vulnerabilities, or find sensitive information from the SIP communications. Furthermore, because the SIP communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. For example, passwords can be extracted. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9862||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. When signed into Sunny Explorer with a wrong password, it is possible to create a debug report, disclosing information regarding the application and allowing the attacker to create and save a .txt file with contents to his liking. An attacker may use this for information disclosure, or to write a file to normally unavailable locations on the local system. NOTE: the vendor reports that "the information contained in the debug report is of marginal significance." Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9863||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. If a user simultaneously has Sunny Explorer running and visits a malicious host, cross-site request forgery can be used to change settings in the inverters (for example, issuing a POST request to change the user password). All Sunny Explorer settings available to the authenticated user are also available to the attacker. (In some cases, this also includes changing settings that the user has no access to.) This may result in complete compromise of the device. NOTE: the vendor reports that exploitation is unlikely because Sunny Explorer is used only rarely. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9864||** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. An attacker can change the plant time even when not authenticated in any way. This changes the system time, possibly affecting lockout policies and random-number generators based on timestamps, and makes timestamps for data analysis unreliable. NOTE: the vendor reports that this is largely irrelevant because it only affects log-entry timestamps, and because the plant time would later be reset via NTP. (It has never been the case that a lockout policy or random-number generator was affected.) Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.
CVE-2017-9865||The function GfxImageColorMap::getGray in GfxState.cc in Poppler 0.54.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted PDF document, related to missing color-map validation in ImageOutputDev.cc.
